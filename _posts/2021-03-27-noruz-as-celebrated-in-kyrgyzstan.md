Noruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, generally around March 21st. The word comes from a combination of two Persian words 'now' meaning new, and "ruz," meaning day. Many cultures have celebrated the spring equinox for over 3,000 years, but the Persian/Iranian calendar, a solar calendar that uses the equinox to mark the first day of the new year, dates from 1079. However, the year that will start on the 2021 equinox is the year 1400, because rather than starting in 1079, it begins in 622 when the Prophet Muhammed completed his pilgrimage to Medina.

Despite the 'year' of the start of the calendar, Noruz is a secular holiday. According to the United Nations, a "cultural tradition observed by numerous peoples, Nowruz is an ancestral festivity marking the first day of spring and the renewal of nature. It promotes values of peace and solidarity between generations and within families as well as reconciliation and neighborliness, thus contributing to cultural diversity and friendship among peoples and different communities."

The traditions of this celebration in Kyrgyzstan including making the traditional dish Somolok, family and village gatherings, and traditional songs and entertainment.
