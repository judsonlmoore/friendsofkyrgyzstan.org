K-7 volunteer Linda Lee Blaine shares her recipe for Chak Chak that she learned while serving in the village of Saruu (Issyk-Kul) from 1999 to 2001.

## Ingredients for making Chak Chak

**Dough**
- 200g flour (about a cup)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- a pinch of salt
- oil for frying

**Syrup**
- 250g honey (1 and 1/4 cup)
- 50g sugar (1/4 cup sugar)

## Directions for making Chak Chak

1. Beat eggs with a fork or hand mixer and add baking soda, salt, and sugar
2. add flour and mix to create a soft dough
3. Put flour on a counter or parchment paper. Knead the dough, adding flour as needed until the dough doesn't stick to parchment paper or fingers. Let the dough sit 20 minutes. 
4. Split the dough into two pieces and roll out very thin. Cut into strips about 1 inch wide and then let sit 10 minutes to dry.
5. Cut strips into tiny pieces (the dough will puff up when frying) 
6. Fry in oil until golden brown. This can be done in a frying pan or deep fat fryer. When removing from the oil, put it on paper towels to absorb excess oil. 
7. Mix honey and sugar and heat on low and bring to a simmer for 1 to 2 minutes
8. Mix honey sauce with fried dough pieces
9. Arrange on a platter or small plates and form into small mountains (you might want to run your hands under cold water to avoid possible burns or stickiness)
