## FOKGZ Welcomes new board members!

**President Brian Cowan.**

Brian was a K-11 volunteer who served in Issyk-kul oblast in the Jeti-Ogus rayon village of Orgorchor.

Brian was a TEFL volunteer who used his connections in his native Tennes-see to coordinate a book drive that resulted in 7,100 books being donated to his school in Orgorchor. Brian was also in country during the Tulip revolution and counts this as one of the most interesting parts of his service. Brian is currently living in Boston and has just completed his first year of law school. In addition to being our newly elected President, Brian is working for the New Hampshire Public Defenders Office.

Brian says he decided to run for the position of President to “put his money where his mouth is” and put some of the desires he had vocalized to the group as NPCA Liaison into action.

Brian’s goals as president include increasing the number of RPCVs who are members of the National Peace Corps Association. Brian also wants FOKGZ to take a more active role in supporting current volunteers in Kyrgyzstan and those nominated to go. Brian also wants to clarify and better articulate the mission of Friends of Kyrgyzstan.

## NPCA Liaison Julie Lusher Rotherham

K-5 TEFL volunteer Julie Rotherham served in the city of Kyzul-Kiya in the southern province of Osh. While in Kyrgyzstan, Julie organized and facilitated a democracy conference for 50 teachers. The conference earned the honor of being the first group allowed access to the Kyrgyz Parliament Building.

Julie also fondly remembers teaching baseball, distributing over 500 pairs of eye-glasses, and working with local teachers and motivated students.

Like most RPCV’s Julie also has some sad stories to tell of bride kidnapping and traveling through war torn Tajikistan. These sad stories though are eclipsed by the memories of teaching and friendships with Kyrgyz children. After completing her service Julie worked with American Councils which gave her the opportunity to complete some of her goals that were left unfulfilled. Back in the states Julie has been a teacher at a rural school in central Virginia until recently when she has taken on the role of mother to 15 month old twin girls. Julie is beginning to think that motherhood is truly “the toughest job you’ll ever love.” Julie decided to run for NPCA liaison because she feels strongly that Kyrgyzstan needs support from people, like RPCVs, that truly know and understand the situation there. Julie’s goals as NPCA liaison include increasing awareness of FOKGZ among recently returned volunteers and increasing membership. Julie also looks forward to reconnecting with Peace Corps friends.

## FOKGZ Gives $500 Grant to the Kind Family Children Home

The FOKGZ board recently voted to give a grant of $500 to a Peace Corps Partnership Project submitted by Peach Corps Volunteer B. Parker from Colorado. The project has been fully funded and is now being implemented!

Below is the description of the project that was submitted.

Kind Family Children Home was created by two families in August, 2004 out of the need to help the homeless children they saw in their community. Currently, Kind Family Children Home houses 27 children and is only able to grow a small percentage of their own food for feeding their children and livestock and thus rely on both food and monetary donations to further cover these needs. They realize that dependence on outside sources is not sustainable and can be unreliable and thus they desire to be self-sufficient. The goal of this project is to increase productivity and self-sufficiency, through the purchase of a tractor, trailer, plough and mower. Kind Family Children Home requests the assistance of the Partnership Program to assist them in purchasing the farming equipment which will allow them to farm the 6 hectares of fallow land they own, but can not currently cultivate due to lack of resources. This project will directly affect the children of the orphanage the most, as they will have more and a greater variety of food to eat. 

In addition, Kind Family Children Home will rent the farm equipment to local community members as Semyonovka Village currently does not have any farming equipment at its disposal. This will provide income generation for Kind Family Children Home to maintain the farming equipment and purchase other necessary items for the children, while providing a much needed service in the community. FOKGZ supported this program through the Peach Corps Partnership Program. The Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP) connects small, community-initiated projects with partners in the United States for financial support.

These connections not only achieve goals in the host community, improving the quality of life for its members, but they foster international understanding between the communities and partners.

Since its inception in 1964, the Partnership Program has assisted thousands of Peace Corps Volunteers, in every Peace Corps country, in order to benefit the health and well-being of their host com-
munities.

To learn more about the Peace Corps Partnership Program visit them on the web at http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.donors The Friends of Kyrgyzstan board would like to thank all the members who donated to FOKGZ to make this grant and our continued work possible! Thank You!
