Dear RPCVs and all others interested in life in Bishkek,

I am back in Italy, looking back over my six months in Bishkek since my last newsletter. I see that I took a lot of photos this year. With the help of many friends, I got out more, I ate out more, I played a bit of tennis, and I even did a bit of dancing at a nightclub and a wedding. There wasn't a lot of hard news (unlike in the U.S.), so this issue is a bit more photo intensive than usual.

## More New Courses

This past semester I taught two new courses. The first was Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for the MBA students. It was the first time it had been taught at the University and of course the first time for me, too. The topic really is the role of the corporation in society. I enjoyed preparing the course because Hewlett-Packard practiced CSR long before the term was invented. David Packard called it "enlightened self-interest." He was frustrated that other CEOs didn't understand why companies should invest in their communities. I taught a case study about HP's current CSR program; I am glad to see the company is still committed to achieving social goals.

On the right, the founder and director of CSR Central Asia talks with the students about environmental sustainability.

The second course was Career Planning for the bachelor's students. Most of them were in their second year and majoring in business. I taught it with a young female instructor, allowing us to offer the students both the new and mature career perspectives, and male-female differences. Though the course had been taught before by another instructor, the school forced us to create our own curriculum. We chose the new NY Times best seller "Designing Your Life" from the Stanford Design Center, as our primary text and "Business Model You," as our second text. 

The course went well. We had 50(!) students in two sections. Some were mature enough for the course, some weren't, but the overall response was very positive. We had guest speakers from Coca-Cola Bottling, Sierra Coffee (the only American speaker), the largest travel agency, a headhunter who has started three companies (including a Thai massage parlor), a guy who just got into the MBA program at the Booth School of Business in Chicago, and a Kyrgyz woman with a business supporting the United Nations staff in the green zone in Kabul. All talked about how their careers took unexpected twists and turns, but they found their paths. Guest speakers are always a hit with the students; "real" people (i.e. not teachers) and real stories. 

We touched on the challenges of dual career couples, quickly discovering that several of the guys didn't want a wife with a career. Big eye-rolls from the women in the class...

<- those are reusable shopping bags. Good advertising for the school and practical!
I tried to help with teaching a course in Management of Information Systems for the MBA program, but that went bust. The first instructor, an American, got sick. His replacement, a local guy with no experience teaching at AUCA, found me a distraction because the students kept coming to me for help because they couldn't understand him. The department head decided to pull me out. I was surprised, but decided not to fight it.

Two students asked me to help them with their senior thesis. One had failed twice before; it turned out the problem was the topic. I got her focused on a growth strategy for her company, IntimMate. She did great. I now know a lot about the manufacturing of women's underwear. I want to turn her thesis into a case study.

Great class. The guy on the left, a former dentist, is opening a cafe. The guy in the electric wheelchair is opening a 3 star hotel that will cater to people with disabilities. The woman next to him owns IntimMate and some how runs it from Moscow. (I didn't take this photo or the one on the right.)

The class had two more men, but they had to take leaves of absence. It's really hard managing work, families and school all at the same time.

This woman produced a second daughter just a few months ago. Doing her thesis about a guest house in Osh was really hard, but she made it.

We celebrated their graduation at Sierra Coffee before I left.

The woman in the polka dot dress has a high class flower business catering to weddings and big events.
Next semester I get to teach "Strategic Management." What the *** is that? Very vague title. Seems it was developed in the 1980s as way to look at business strategy from the perspective of the CEO and board of directors. Topics include mergers & acquisitions, diversification, vertical integration, portfolio management (dogs, stars, cows....) and so forth. I hope the students are ready for these topics. I have four large textbooks to read this summer. Seems Harvard's Prof. Michael Porter is once again the leading writer in this space. He pops up everywhere. His writings were also the cornerstone for my course on Corporate Social Responsibility.

I am also going to co-teach, for the second time, a course on Urban Development. When we did it two years ago the students really got a lot out of it, so I am looking forward to teaching it again and doing it even better.

## Kyrgyzstan - Innovation Hub for Central Asia?

The economy of the Kyrgyz Republic is growing. Not very fast, but more and more SUVs are clogging up the streets, more luxury apartment buildings are going up, restaurants are getting better, and roads and sidewalks are being repaired. I have fallen in with a group that sees innovation and technology as a potential differentiator for the country. Efforts to promote creativity and innovation are growing in the high schools, in larger companies, in the form of co-working spaces, and fora such as hackathons and ["fuckup" nights](https://fuckupnights.com/bishkek/) where entrepreneurs share their biggest mistakes. We have had TEDx events for several years. There is an atmosphere of social and business freedom and experimentation in Bishkek that does not exist in Kazakhstan, despite their greater wealth. 

One sector I want to learn more about is outsourcing creative services like advertising, graphic design, interior design and software development. Years ago I visited a company in Bishkek that was developing print and web advertising for companies in Russia and Kazakhstan. Recently, the wife of a good friend got her license to do interior design work and is now doing 3D designs for homes and offices in the US and other countries. The software allows her to include furnishings and fixtures that are available in the US and other markets.

It's incredible. How big is the outsourcing industry in Kyrgyzstan? I met with head of the software association she told me the largest member has 50 employees and virtually all of their work is for clients in the US. I'm guessing there are a few thousand people in this business and they are probably making good money. How can we encourage the growth of this industry?

## Peace Corps News

I am not in close contact with the Peace Corps, but I run into Volunteers here and there. The big news is that there is a plan to go back up to over 100 Volunteers of the next couple years. Healthcare and business is almost gone, but TEFL is going strong, and youth programming is growing. Volunteers are no longer expected to spend all two years living with a host family. I hear host family living continues to be a challenge for Volunteers and the families. That experience is great for learning the language and culture, but so hard in practice for so many reasons. I always hear high compliments from the Volunteers about Peace Corps staff; they are a great team.

## Living the Ex-Pat Life

The expat community in Kyrgyzstan is small and pretty stable in size. The American Embassy crew seems to keep pretty much to itself. Other embassies show up more at the local restaurants and nightclubs. Lots of teachers come from the US and Europe, many teaching English and French. Then there are the Fulbright Scholars and other academics who hang out for a year or so while doing their research, then drop by every now and again. Quite a few UN people. 

We mingle pretty well. On Wednesdays we compete at Pub Quizzes at Burger House. The [Hash Harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers) have established a toe-hold. "Drinkers with a running problem," is their motto. Per Wikipedia, their mission is,

- To promote physical fitness among our members
- To get rid of weekend hangovers
- To acquire a good thirst and to satisfy it in beer
- To persuade the older members that they are not as old as they feel

Yes, founded by the Brits in Malaysia, long ago. Not being a runner, I do not partake in their antics, but the Hash Harriers are a social institution in many countries. They serve as a counterpoint to the more serious Rotarians and Lions.

The English language movie club recently attracted a large crowd of Indian medical students who got very vocal at the showing of the latest "Fast and Furious" episode (not my favorite genre, but it's in a real theater!). 

The annual, three day, international Jazz Festival continues fill the Philharmonia with creative, multi-cultural, jazz creations and audiences. Museum night - the third so far - attracted thousands to the public museums and free music performances in the city center. I went with a current second year student from Mongolia and an alumna of the MBA program who recently married an American and will likely move to the US. We had a great time and ran into friends and colleagues everywhere we went.

AUCA students. I don't know them, but they recognized me from school.

A photo club set up a portrait studio in a theater. These photos were taken with my camera. We are waiting for the official versions. 

This is Anna. She graduated from the MBA program a couple years ago and has married an American. Seattle is her temporary home.
	
Buyanna is a second year student from Ulan Bator, Mongolia. Very adventurous. Psychology major and interested in wind turbines for powering remote villages.
I got a call from the casting director for a new movie asking for help finding ex-pats who could act and/or be extras. I ended up getting a real role for a colleague in the law department at the university, roles as extras for a few other friends, and a bit part (no lines) for myself. This would never happen to me in the US! My third movie!
 
[The trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaZQSVxcQk4)

My job was to hustle a prisoner out of the room in the background.

The real star of the movie is the Russian guy on the left. That's his wife on the right. We all hung out together at the after party. I could get used to this movie making lifestyle!

Kaykay (Minnesota) on the left played the daughter, Steve played her father, and Aiga wants to be an actress. She and Kaykay teach English at English Zone.

A friend started a capoeira club ([video about what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD18ilKj5R0)). It's a Brazilian martial arts training program that involves dance and music. She has attracted several ex-pats and their kids, along with a few locals. I went to a couple sessions the the basement of a kindergarten.

I got some indoor tennis during the winter, but couldn't maintain the momentum in the spring. It has been hard to hold a group together. 
Several of the locals switch to golf as soon as the snow stops. Yes, we have golf. One 9 hole course with quite a few passionate players who never seem to get bored.

	
Supara, the ethic restaurant built several years ago by the founder of Shoro beverage company has opened second restaurant, Chong Kurchak, in the mountains. It's a 90 minute drive, but the views, clean air, and great shashlik (barbecued, marinated meat on a skewer with raw onions) are worth it.

It's kumiz season - fermented horse milk. Lots of colts competing with the humans for their mothers' milk. Good and good for you...

Chong Kurchak has places to stay (fake yurts) and conference facilities for business events.

Bishkeki's love a parade. Victory Day, May 9 used to involve a military parade and honored the survivors of "the Great War." This year, there was little sign of the military. Instead, thousands of people walked along a major boulevard carrying photos of the war dead. I was surprised by how many people showed up for the walk. If you want to get a sense of how many people from the Soviet Union died in the war, [watch this animated presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKPFT-RioU). I used it in a class on data visualization; very moving.

At the war memorial. Remember the "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me" story about the homeless guys caught roasting potatoes over the eternal flame?
	
In the last two months I have been to two weddings, one in Bishkek the other in Italy. The contrasts between them are striking. The Kyrgyz wedding was a family affair at a cafe that specializes in big events. About 300 people from both families came to socialize and enjoy entertainment and an abundance of food. All generations showed up, from kids to great-grandparents. Each family group (about 8 groups) gathered in turn to make speeches and toast the happy couple. Even I had to make a speech.

In a break with custom, there was no alcohol. Some were disappointed, but most people thought it was a great idea. The piece de resistance was horse meat (and fat) brought in by the staff with great ceremony. There was no marriage ceremony; that was done in the official wedding hall as a civil ceremony. In between ethnic dance performances, hip hop singers, and magicians, we got up and did circle dances. The better dancers, male and female, jumped into the center to show off their moves and drag in their cousins. When the party was over, all went home with "packettes" of leftover food to enjoy at home. 

Groom in the traditional kalpak hat is the brother of a friend of mine.
	
The service staff was amazing. They had the distribution of food and cleaning up all choreographed with precision. And the food was great.
The wedding in Italy was at a villa, a resort with swimming pool and many amenities. Parents and immediate family members were there, but unlike at the Kyrgyz wedding, the great majority of guests were friends of the couple. They came from the US and Italy and spent several days enjoying themselves before and after the big event. The wedding ceremony was outdoors, with vows exchanged, and carefully curated music in the background. Dining and dancing went on for many hours.

Another difference: the wedding in Italy was of two women, one American the other Italian. They met and live in Seattle. They got married there first, then repeated their vows in Italy with friends and families. Italy still doesn't recognize gay marriage, but cultural attitudes are changing. 

## What's Next for Me?

This fall I want to do less teaching and more working in the community. I want to help with building an "Innovation Hub" as a partnership of local entrepreneurs and the universities. I want to do more coaching of young entrepreneurs and help small companies develop strategies for growth. I also want to do more career counseling for students and adults based on the career planning course I taught this spring.

UN Women is very interested in the work I did on soap operas for social change in 2012. The director wants to train his staff and partner organizations on behavior change methods. I have connected him with Population Media in Vermont, the organization I worked with a few years ago to help out with a television series here. They are working on proposals for capacity building now. It would be amazing to see that concept take root here. 

One member of the staff at AUCA asked me for help because she was getting bored with job. She said she has discovered women in her community who are bored with staying at home with their children. She wants to help them find meaningful work. Soon after talking with her, I noticed groups of small stands near shopping malls where women were selling miscellaneous small toys and kitchen goods, and handicrafts, including honey, tea, and felt products. When I asked about them, I found out that someone has set up a program to give these women free space to sell things as a way of giving them something to do and an income. Seems to be working. Could it be the initiative of a politician angling for votes? It will be interesting to see if it lasts past the elections in November.

I have no plans to return to the US. I see Bishkek as one of my homes now, and there are a lot of opportunities to help the country develop. Academia is not where I want to be in the long run, but teaching does help me connect with the community and it provides me with endless opportunities to learn. 

There's a lot more to write about, but these Bulletins can get tedious, so below you will find more photos without a lot of text.
All the best. Keep in touch.

In Central Asia, the celebration of the arrival of spring in March is called Nooruz. Students at the University dressed in their native costumes and delivered platters of sweet, sticky, food to all the departments.

Sumoluk is the special dish for Nooruz. It is made by grinding wheat sprouts and cooking the mash for 24 hours. AUCA students stayed up all night doing it at Supara. Big party.

There is a competition for the best sumolok that is taken very seriously. Like a chili cook-off. Universities, businesses and non-profits field teams of cooks. 

There were several traditional games at Supara. I did not try this one for fear that my back would never recover.

sumoluk - yummy. Very sweet. Kids like it more than grownups.

The swings are long boards that can hold a lot of kids.
	
I was surprised to learn that few Bishkekis know how to use a bow and arrow. I think the sport is becoming a little more popular. I hope they don't lose the tradition.
	
Ala Too Square now has a lot of lights. The National Museum, in the center, is in the final stages of restoration. 

View of Victory Square from one of the new office buildings.

The flying saucer on the right is the circus. The building under construction in the center will house a Hard Rock Cafe and hotel. 

Sierra Coffee celebrated their 5 year anniversary. They have a second cafe in the Tash Rabat department store and they manage the cafeteria at the American Embassy. 

Chicken Star celebrated their second year. The owner, with icing on his face, is an artist, salsa dancer, and graduate of AUCA. The restaurant serves lots of chicken with Korean flavors. There is frequent entertainment, salsa dancing, and events. Very popular with students, Peace Corps Volunteers, and ex-pats, including me. And they have Moosehead beer!

On March 8, Women's Day, there was a march for the rights of women, LGBTQ, and differently-abled people. It was a small, but dedicated group with quite a few members of the AUCA faculty. One university put on a production of the Vagina Monologues. 

The food trucks are coming! It started with Fresco ice cream a few years ago. Now there are coffee shops on wheels and doner kebabs. What's next?

Yes, that's me with the human glow worm. At the Retro Metro night club with friends. Retro Metro targets the "older" market, i.e. anyone who has finished school. I qualify!

There was a conference on urban issues in Kyrgyzstan. For the first time, all the major cities participated actively and are now sharing their ideas for planning, bicycles, safety, recreation, water, and more. The above is an abstract map of Bishkek to which people are adding their ideas and comments. I'm hoping to teach urban development again, next year. 

P.S. the Ferris wheel in Panfilov Park was removed. It was very old. Maybe a safety hazard? It offered a great view of the city. I hope they put in a new one.
