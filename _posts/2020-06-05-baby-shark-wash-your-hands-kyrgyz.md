## Wash your hands and be careful!

Washing your hands is one of the best ways to protect yourself from the coronavirus. Lately, we have forgotten the rules of proper hand washing, in other words, we seem to wash less now than in the beginning of quarantine. It is important to note that our hands are one of the most common ways the virus is spread from person to person. One of the simplest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of the virus is to wash your hands with soap. Let's take care of our health together.

Watch this video, take a 30-second video with your child, sister or brother, use the hashtag #koldujuu and upload it to your page, using proper hand washing techniques. Whoever's video is interesting, original and useful will win a prize from us. Letâ€™s go, then, combine healthy and pleasant work and stay healthy.

Thanks for all the help making this and contributing voices, FLEX KG Community and The Luciana Malana Board!
