Ashlam-fu is a traditionally Uighur and Dungan meal that is popular throughout Kyrgyzstan, especially the Issyk-Kul region. This hearty spicy noodle dish is typically served cold a contains starch gelatin, hand-stretched noodles, vegetables, eggs, meat, spices, and vinegar. 

For the purposes of this food challenge, I created a speedy Americanized vegetarian version* that anyone can make with the ingredients found in your pantry! Here are the ingredients you will need:

- A pack of your favorite noodles (I used a pack of rice noodles)
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 carrot
- 2 tomatoes
- 2 green onions
- 2 tsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp vinegar
- Spices to taste: salt, pepper, garlic, dill, parsley, pepper flakes, dried chives

First, you’ll want to make the sauce. Chop the carrots, green onions, pepper, and tomatoes into long thin strips. Then pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil into a heated pan. Add the vegetable strips and stir vigorously. Add some garlic, salt, and pepper. Let these fry for one minute. Then pour in a half cup of water and stew the mixture for 5-7 minutes.

While the sauce mixture is stewing, take your milk and two eggs in a separate pan and fry up an omelet. Let the omelet cool for a minute and then cut it into long thin strips. Mix the egg strips into the sauce mixture while stirring vigorously. Add spices to taste and remove from the heat.

Put the sauce mixture in the fridge to chill. While your sauce is chilling, you can cook up your noodles in boiling salted water. Once tender, rinse the noodles several times in cold water. Then add the second teaspoon of vegetable oil, season to taste, and mix.

When both the sauce and noodles are chilled, you can lay the noodles in a deep plate and pile the sauce on top. Add a dollop of laza (or sriracha or your favorite spicy sauce), sprinkle with any additional seasonings, mix, and enjoy!
