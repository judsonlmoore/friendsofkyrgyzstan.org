As a volunteer in Naryn, the winters were six months long and the thawing of the snow to reveal rolling green pastures was highly anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The availability of juz-ay, a type of onion similar to the Chinese garlic chive, was a signal of spring coming and the beginning of the availability of fresh produce. I would often sit at the kitchen table across from my host mom and practice my Kyrgyz with her as she would lovingly prepare the dough for this recipe. Juz-ay in this recipe can be substituted with regular chives, spring onions or even regular yellow onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oromo is also commonly made with diced pumpkin or meat fillings. The most authentic version of this dish also uses kaimak (clotted cream) instead of the vegetable oil and/or butter. It is often served with laza, a type of chili oil that is similar to the chili oil that you can find in your local Asian grocery store. This recipe yields two oromos, which is about 4 to 6 servings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the dough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200 mL warm water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the filling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 large bunch of garlic chives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt and pepper to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neutral oil such as avocado oil or vegetable oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For serving&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chili oil (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the dough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissolve salt in warm water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add flour and the egg to a mixing bowl along with the water mixture and knead until the dough is smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover the dough bowl with a kitchen towel and leave it to rest for twenty minutes (you can prepare the filling during this time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat butter or oil in a pan over medium heat and saute the onions and chives until softened. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the same pan, heat butter or oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Beat the eggs lightly (there is no need to beat them too vigorously) and add to the pan. Fry until the eggs are fully cooked and set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To assemble and cook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the dough in half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll out the first half of the dough on a large flat surface until the dough is as thin as it can possibly be without tearing. The thickness should be that of a thick sheet of paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spread half of the filling evenly over the full surface area of the dough. (The filling according to this recipe will be more than what is pictured below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll the dough into a log shape and then set onto a greased steaming rack of a steamer pot.&lt;/p&gt;

The stories varied, but together they emphasized the importance of volunteer projects, not only to the community, but to the volunteer. While Carol Spahn, Peace Corps Director, talked about driving inclusivity and promoting environmental sustainability in projects, other points have continued to replay in my mind as considerations for how we promote, support, and fund PCV projects in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As communities are inviting the Peace Corps in to support them, Peace Corps asks that projects are community driven. This can be a challenge for volunteers as we want to solve the problems they see and not those the community sees as a priority. Likewise, volunteers must be careful not to pose solutions but to facilitate them. After all, a community driven solution based on their self-identified needs is more likely to be long-lasting. Community involvement at every step of a project phase should be considered for funding ongoing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projects train volunteers in management and human relations. Often, we are used to having resources and knowhow at our disposal and therefore to taking quick action. It is easy to mistake the first goal of Peace Corps “Help the people of interested countries in meeting their need for trained men and women” as a call to simply fill the gap. A volunteer might think “I was brought in as the resource and the knowhow” and take on a role quickly. Taking a step back and support the community to assess what the community already knows, what they truly need and then connecting them with the right resources is not only more efficient, but shares leadership development opportunity with others, develops better listening and communication skills and teaches compassion and patience. In this light, donations to projects go to communities, but also to volunteer training in skills they need in today’s workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most impactful to me was that volunteers don’t always see or feel their success at the end of service, especially when there is not a tangible achievement to show like a new well or irrigation system. With many of the volunteers in Kyrgyzstan being education volunteers, this is likely very common. But the Peace Corps goal is 3-fold and often the cultural exchange goals have more lasting impact than the service and skill goal. Spahn mentioned during the panel that in exit interviews, relationships built are the most memorable and valuable part of volunteer service. That rings true for me! Projects are a fantastic opportunity for volunteers to integrate with the community at various relationship levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contributing to small projects beyond their core focus  (i.e. an education volunteer sponsors a small construction project), volunteers have a chance to meet more tangible skill based goals, but more importantly get to meet more diverse communities with whom to share their story (the second goal - Help promote a better understanding of Americans) and, in turn, can share a broader perspective about the community when they return to the US (the third goal - Help promote a better understanding of other peoples on the part of Americans).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of Kyrgyzstan exists to fund Peace Corps volunteer projects. Following this panel, my commitment to this effort is renewed/re-invigorated. By thinking about the more ongoing reach of our donations, helps me to understand the true impact that even small projects can make on the volunteer and community experience with a volunteer. Knowing that my contributions, both in time and in donations, are going to help communities, individuals, volunteers, and that the benefit of that knowledge and positive experience will extend through conversation, I am grateful to be a part of this organization and to work with a great team of RPCVs who live the third goal – helping to promote a better understanding of other peoples on the part of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

While Carol Spahn, Peace Corps Director, talked about driving inclusivity and promoting environmental sustainability in projects, other points have continued to replay in my mind as considerations for how we promote, support, and fund PCV projects in Kyrgyzstan.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2021/04/peace-corps-volunteer-interviewed-in-kyrgyzstan.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2021/04/peace-corps-volunteer-interviewed-in-kyrgyzstan.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Persian New Year (Noruz) as celebrated in Kyrgyzstan</title><link href="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/noruz-as-celebrated-in-kyrgyzstan" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Persian New Year (Noruz) as celebrated in Kyrgyzstan" /><published>2021-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/noruz-as-celebrated-in-kyrgyzstan</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/noruz-as-celebrated-in-kyrgyzstan">&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the 2021 Persian New Year, Noruz (or Nowruz), as it is celebrated in Kyrgyzstan, Friends of Kyrgyzstan hosted an online conversation with a diverse group of attendees to mark the occasion.

&lt;p&gt;Noruz is celebrated on the spring equinox, generally around March 21st. The word comes from a combination of two Persian words ‘now’ meaning new, and “ruz,” meaning day. Many cultures have celebrated the spring equinox for over 3,000 years, but the Persian/Iranian calendar, a solar calendar that uses the equinox to mark the first day of the new year, dates from 1079. However, the year that will start on the 2021 equinox is the year 1400, because rather than starting in 1079, it begins in 622 when the Prophet Muhammed completed his pilgrimage to Medina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ‘year’ of the start of the calendar, Noruz is a secular holiday. According to the United Nations, a “cultural tradition observed by numerous peoples, Nowruz is an ancestral festivity marking the first day of spring and the renewal of nature. It promotes values of peace and solidarity between generations and within families as well as reconciliation and neighborliness, thus contributing to cultural diversity and friendship among peoples and different communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditions of this celebration in Kyrgyzstan including making the traditional dish Somolok, family and village gatherings, and traditional songs and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2-3 pounds lamb roast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tomato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 potato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 carrot (or any vegetables you have around)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1-gallon water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt and pepper, to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 bay leaves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trimmings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 onions, thinly sliced and divided&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sprig of dill, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 sprig of parsley, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noodles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 cups water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1.5 lb flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dash of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the broth, heat a large pot filled with water and the meat on high heat. When it starts to boil, lower the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blanch the meat for about 30-60 minutes, then drain through a strainer. Rinse the meat well. Return to the pot and cover with fresh water and return to a boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 halved tomato, 1 halved onion, onion skin, and any other vegetables you have lying around that will make the broth tasty. (I added carrots and potatoes and the stems from the dill and parsley).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skim off any of the foam, cover, and let simmer for about 1-2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that is boiling, make the dough and let it rest. Sift the flour, mix the eggs and water together. Add a dash of salt and oil to the water and mix thoroughly with your hand. Add a bit of flour and mix. Then add the rest of the sifted flour and mix until incorporated. It will be sticky. Turn out on to a floured surface and knead until soft and not sticky. Put under a bowl to keep air out and leave to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinly slice 2 onions in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. As the broth boils, periodically skim the fat from the top of the broth and add over the onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the meat is completely tender, turn off the heat and remove the meat from the pot. Let it cool. Then shred the lamb with two forks or cut into bite-sized pieces and set aside. Cut off any fat pieces and shred them finely and add to the sliced onions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate the broth into 2 portions - Set enough broth aside for 3/4 cups of broth, and to this portion, add the bay leaves and season with salt. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Let it boil for about 5 minutes and then simmer until ready to serve. Serve this broth in individual bowls per person garnished with chopped dill and parsley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the other portion of broth, add enough water as necessary to boil the noodles. Add salt as necessary. Bring to a boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portion the dough into a few sections and knead each a bit. Roll out each portion of dough into super-thin sheets. Cut into roughly 2”x3” strips- perfection not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly drip the noodles one by one o to the noodle broth and boil for approximately 5 minutes or to your taste — drain and place on a large serving plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return the meat and vegetables to the broth to reheat. And top the noodles with the lamb and vegetables. Garnish with dill and parsley if desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serve immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leftovers? Fry them up in a bit of oil. Crispy noodles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients-for-making-chak-chak&quot;&gt;Ingredients for making Chak Chak&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200g flour (about a cup)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 large eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp. sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp. baking soda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil for frying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syrup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;250g honey (1 and 1/4 cup)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50g sugar (1/4 cup sugar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;directions-for-making-chak-chak&quot;&gt;Directions for making Chak Chak&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beat eggs with a fork or hand mixer and add baking soda, salt, and sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add flour and mix to create a soft dough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put flour on a counter or parchment paper. Knead the dough, adding flour as needed until the dough doesn’t stick to parchment paper or fingers. Let the dough sit 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split the dough into two pieces and roll out very thin. Cut into strips about 1 inch wide and then let sit 10 minutes to dry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut strips into tiny pieces (the dough will puff up when frying)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fry in oil until golden brown. This can be done in a frying pan or deep fat fryer. When removing from the oil, put it on paper towels to absorb excess oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix honey and sugar and heat on low and bring to a simmer for 1 to 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix honey sauce with fried dough pieces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arrange on a platter or small plates and form into small mountains (you might want to run your hands under cold water to avoid possible burns or stickiness)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-love-plov&quot;&gt;Why I love plov&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a volunteer in Talas, I lived with a family who loved to cook plov, and I picked up the habit from them. To be fair, of all the Kyrgyz food, plov is my favorite (though, of course, it is hard to choose a single favorite from all the great options).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my host family, I learned to cook plov in the traditional way, but when I moved out to live on my own, I discovered an alternative recipe in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/cookbook/&quot;&gt;Peace Corps Kyrgyzstan Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;, which became my go-to when I cook plov myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scandalously, this “Southern Plov” recipe calls for such additions as raisins and pineapple, which is likely why I like it so much because I also love Hawaiian Pizza. I also preferred that the recipe used chicken meat instead of mutton, though while I still lived in Talas, I almost always used duck breast because this was always available at my local kiosk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I am an RPCV, I often cook plov for house guests and family. Below is my adaptation for how to cook plov from southern Kyrgyzstan. I hope that you will try it and love it as much as I do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients-for-plov&quot;&gt;Ingredients for plov&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the ingredients for plov are common all around the world or are easily substitutable. You can replace the chicken meat with duck, mutton, beef, or wholly omitted to make a vegetarian plov. Uzgen rice is by far the best rice for plov, but outside of the Central Asian region, this will be very hard to come by, so I usually use regular long-grain rice instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 tsp salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 bay leafs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 packet plov spices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6 cloves garlic, peeled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 cups Uzbek rice (or long-grain rice)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄4 cup sunflower oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄4 cup maple syrup or honey&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup diced carrots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup diced onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup diced peppers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1⁄2 cup of raisins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 pineapple, chopped (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am cooking this from Germany, so the ingredients pictured above have German names. Sorry for the confusion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to cook plov for guests and events because it is a very affordable way to feed a lot of people without creating a lot of dirty dishes along the way. Aside from a fair amount of slicing and dicing ingredients at the beginning, the whole dish is just adding things to a pot in the right order and at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you get started cooking plov, I recommend that you prepare by cutting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chicken (or other meat)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carrots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;peppers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; look for pre-cut carrots at your local grocery; this will save you a considerable amount of time and effort! You can also buy the pineapples in a can already sliced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-soak-rice-in-saltwater-for-2-hours&quot;&gt;1. Soak rice in saltwater for 2 hours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you were in Kyrgyzstan, did you have to clean and sort rice purchased from the bazaar one grain at a time to identify pebbles? I sure did! Luckily, you probably do not need to do that with pre-packaged rice purchased at a grocery store. Nonetheless, it is advisable to clean rice from any source in salt a saltwater bath. This also helps soften the rice before cooking it, so that it will cook faster and not overcook the other ingredients already in the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of one for cooking with oil, so I try to keep this to a minimum. I’ve tried a few other types of oil but always come back to sunflower oil. For plov, it just seems to extract the best flavor profiles from the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-heat-on-high-add-chicken-carrots-onions-and-peppers&quot;&gt;3. Heat on high, add chicken, carrots, onions, and peppers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the oil is heated up, add the chicken, followed by the carrots, onions, and peppers. You can put these all in at once. By adding the chicken first, the chicken soaks up the oil first, giving it a fried texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally stir the ingredients to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning. &lt;strong&gt;Very important:&lt;/strong&gt; leave the lid off so that moisture can escape; otherwise, you’ll be making a plov soup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-add-plov-spices-packet&quot;&gt;5. Add plov spices packet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can get your hands on a plov spice packet like the ones shown in the photo above, add them here. If you cannot find such a package near you, you can make plov spice mix by mixing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp coriander, ground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp paprika&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tsp black pepper, ground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 cloves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 Tbsp wild black cumin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt (to taste)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-stir-everything-thoroughly&quot;&gt;6. Stir everything thoroughly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the chicken is looking cooked and the carrots are softening, ensure everything is thoroughly mixed so that all the spices are evenly distributed, and there are no clumps of anything sticking together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-drain-and-rinse-uncooked-rice&quot;&gt;7. Drain and rinse uncooked rice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can drain and rinse the rice from its salt bath. A spaghetti strainer is usually suitable for this job; just make sure that the holes are small enough to catch the rice. Consider catching the water in another pot just in case some rice does get through the strainer. Run tap water over the drained rice to clean it of any other residues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-add-rice-so-its-covering-all-ingredients&quot;&gt;8. Add rice, so it’s covering all ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few steps, you need a little bit of speed. Remember: the heat is high, and the ingredients on the bottom of the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, evenly distribute the cleaned rice across the top of the other ingredients. Make this as flat and even as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-add-raisins&quot;&gt;9. Add raisins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all of the raisins on top of the rice as evenly as possible. Don’t worry about any clumping of the raisins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-add-pineapple-if-using-and-maple-syrup-or-honey&quot;&gt;10. Add pineapple (if using) and maple syrup or honey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add pineapple evenly on top of the raisins and drizzle with maple syrup or honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;11-add-bay-leaves&quot;&gt;11. Add bay leaves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a few bay leaves around the gaps between the pineapples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;12-add-water-so-that-rice-is-just-barely-covered&quot;&gt;12. Add water so that rice is just barely covered&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now pour in water (better if it is hot, even pre-boiled from a kettle) so that everything in the pot is just below the water’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;13-cover-pot-and-let-the-water-boil-down-again-roughly-10-minutes&quot;&gt;13. Cover pot and let the water boil down again (roughly 10 minutes)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover the pot on high heat and let the water boil down. Note that you should check this every 5-7 minutes, and you might want to add more water back in 1-2 times, again covering all ingredients in water. Be careful not to overdo it (again: you’re not making soup!), but by adding water once or twice, you will ensure that the rice cooks properly. Just test the rice as you go and if the water level is getting low and the rice is still hard, add more water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you add too much water, tilt the pot to drain it out or leave the lid off for a while so that the water can boil out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 20-30 minutes of cooking on high-heat, and maybe 1-2 additional rounds of topping off the water-level, the rice should be getting soft and tasting like something you want to eat. Also: the smell will be fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the rice is appropriately soft, use a large spoon to mix the contents of the pot. Go slowly, and do your best to raise the ingredients from the bottom of the pot to the top to get everything as mixed as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover on low heat for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it might be a scandal to cook plov with pineapple, raisins, and meat that is not mutton. At least for us volunteers from the north of Kyrgyzstan, these ingredients were unheard of in plov. Nonetheless, this variation is a delicious dish that is sure to please all who taste it! Just be sure to serve it with lots of stories of your service and fond memories of Kyrgyzstan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air is getting a little chilly, the leaves are changing colors, and it’s the perfect time of year to spend an evening inside making a cozy meal! Making manti is a great family/group activity– there’s a job for everyone! And the end result is so delicious too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manti are large steamed buns popular throughout Central Asia. They are most often made with beef, lamb, or potatoes. But in the fall my favorite type of manti starts appearing in the bazaar– pumpkin manti! You can use sugar pumpkins or any type of winter squash.  For this recipe we used acorn squash and kabocha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the dough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;5 cups flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cups of water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the filling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 large onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1½ lbs  pumpkin pieces (or other winter squash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 medium russet potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lb ground beef and lamb mixed (or double the pumpkin and leave out!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of chopped parsley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional spices: paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, chili powder, garlic and onion powder, dill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-combine-all-of-the-dough&quot;&gt;1. Combine all of the dough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combine all of the dough ingredients together. Knead dough for a few minutes until a smooth ball forms. Let the dough rest for about thirty minutes. Knead again for a few minutes and let rest for thirty more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-chop-the-pumpkin-onion-and-potato&quot;&gt;2. Chop the pumpkin, onion, and potato&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a food processor to chop the pumpkin, onion, and potato into small pebble-size pieces. For best results chop each ingredient separately and combine in a large bowl. You can also chop by hand! (no easy feat for the pumpkin!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-mix-in-a-bowl&quot;&gt;3. Mix in a bowl&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once chopped combine pumpkin, parsley, spices, and oil and mix in a bowl. If you make too much filling, you can freeze it and save for later.  You can also add the mixture to a stir fry or soup!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-combine-beef-and-lamb-optional&quot;&gt;4. Combine beef and lamb (optional)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to make some manti with meat, combine beef and lamb in a bowl with salt and pepper.  Add some of the pumpkin mixture so you have roughly half and half (or whatever your preferred ratio is!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we made vegetarian manti, we don’t have a photo to support this optional step. Instead, here is a Kyrgyz sheep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-roll-dough&quot;&gt;5. Roll dough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a rolling pin, roll dough out into a thin sheet (about 1/8th of an inch). If you have a pasta maker you could also use that, though the dough is very soft and we found it easier to roll out by hand. (More fun too!)  My rolling skills are not at the level of a Kyrgyz apa, so I divided the dough into four pieces before rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-cut-dough-into-circles&quot;&gt;6. Cut dough into circles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a large cup or biscuit cutter to cut dough into circles. My Kyrgyz apa used a tea cup, I used a pint glass or small bowl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-stuff-and-fold-the-dough&quot;&gt;7. Stuff and fold the dough&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put about a tablespoon of filling in the center of dough, being careful to leave a large border.  There are many ways to fold manti, the easiest we found was to pinch opposing corners together in the center and create a little pouch. This is the fun part! Experiment with different ways of folding! (at this point we realized we had way too many manti! Depending on the size of your manti making crew, you may come to the same conclusion. Feel free to toss some in the freezer to eat later!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cook: boil water in your steamer. Oil the steamer tray and place manti, leaving some space between each (they’ll get a little bigger as they steam!) Steam for about 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need a clay oven&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need to wait for dough to proof&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are much faster and easier to make&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dough type opens up a broader range of compatible fillings – like potatoes or fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved the doughy goodness of vereniki, oromo, lyapyoshki, samsa (the list goes on), but I never really had the patience to make it. I’ve always left that to my Russian mother-in-law or some other ambitious baker. So, when my mother-in-law also started taking shortcuts like using puff pastry for samsa and using a pastry press for vereniki, I admit I felt a lot less guilty for my impatience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filling is simple, using ingredients usually on hand and just a ½ pound of ground meat (preferably lamb) or 2 cups of shredded pumpkin. You can also do season 2 cups of diced potatoes similar to the meat. Or, if you have less on hand, make a couple of each. Plus, you can adjust the seasoning or add-ins to your taste. See how flexible? The key to the Kyrgyz flavor is freshly crushed dried cumin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this recipe even easier, you can use ready-made fillings. It takes away the Kyrgyz flavors, but samsa exists in so many cultures. Experimentation can be a trip around the world. Thick packaged curry, like bhindi masala would be a go-to for me, or aloo matar. Any leftover vegetables with some cheese help when you are trying to clean out your fridge. Apple pie filling makes for a great dessert with ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you try out this recipe and enjoy the speed, ease, and flexibility! Experiment with fillings and share your experience. #MakeItYourself #FOKGZ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipe for Easy Samsa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes 12 samsa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bake at 380 degrees for 25 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat filling (for 12)f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 pound ground meat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/4 c diced onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/3 c finely diced raw potato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 clove crushed/minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon crushed cumin seeds (put them between parchment, paper, or foil and roll over them with a rolling pin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumpkin filling (for 12)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 c shredded pumpkin (butternut squash will do in a pinch)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/4 c diced onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 clove crushed/minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 tsp crushed cumin seeds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sugar (depending on the natural flavor and sweetness of the pumpkin and your taste)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potato filling (for 12)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 c diced raw potato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/4 c diced onions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 clove crushed/minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 teaspoon crushed cumin seeds (put them between parchment, paper, or foil and roll over them with a rolling pin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 pkg (1lb) puff pastry dough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1-2 tablespoon oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 egg, beaten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 380 degrees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover a cookie sheet or pizza stone with parchment paper or tinfoil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil parchment paper or tinfoil, using a pastry brush or a paper towel dipped in the oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare the filling in advance of starting to work with the dough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprinkle flour onto a clean work surface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the puff pastry dough and flour both sides&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut the dough in half, parallel to the longer side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut each of those halves into 6 ‘bars’, cutting parallel to the short side – each will be about 1’ x 1’ x 3’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn them onto the cut side, pinch them together from each of the smaller ends (like an accordion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press them down a bit with your fingers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roll each out to a square(ish) a bit bigger than your palm (not too thin or it will break open when baking, but thin enough that you can pull the edges together over the filling)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill each with about 2 tablespoons of filling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gather the dough from the left and the right (like a paper fan) to the middle over the filling and seal together like a little purse (Make sure to seal it well so the filling does not leak and burn onto the pan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the samsa, sealed side down, onto the oiled pan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the pastry brush or folded paper towel, baste all exposed sides of the samsa with the beaten egg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bake at 380 for 25 minutes – checking toward the end so that they don’t get over browned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow to cool for a minute before removing from the pan&lt;/p&gt;

This hearty spicy noodle dish is typically served cold a contains starch gelatin, hand-stretched noodles, vegetables, eggs, meat, spices, and vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this food challenge, I created a speedy Americanized vegetarian version* that anyone can make with the ingredients found in your pantry! Here are the ingredients you will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you’ll want to make the sauce. Chop the carrots, green onions, pepper, and tomatoes into long thin strips. Then pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil into a heated pan. Add the vegetable strips and stir vigorously. Add some garlic, salt, and pepper. Let these fry for one minute. Then pour in a half cup of water and stew the mixture for 5-7 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the sauce mixture is stewing, take your milk and two eggs in a separate pan and fry up an omelet. Let the omelet cool for a minute and then cut it into long thin strips. Mix the egg strips into the sauce mixture while stirring vigorously. Add spices to taste and remove from the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the sauce mixture in the fridge to chill. While your sauce is chilling, you can cook up your noodles in boiling salted water. Once tender, rinse the noodles several times in cold water. Then add the second teaspoon of vegetable oil, season to taste, and mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ааламга сапар айылдан башталат&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Astra Rakhmatilla Kyzy, and I am 27 years old. I am originally from Kyzylbel, a small village in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan. Since I was born and grew up in a small village, I always wondered how big the world is and how people live in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super curious as a child and used to read a lot of books. I learned to read really early with the help of my mother. She was a librarian, and instead of telling me stories or reading to me, my mother taught me to read and gave me a bunch of books. I became a bookworm at an early age and had my own world. That’s when I started to dream of seeing the world and studying somewhere other than my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was nine years old when my oldest brother told me that if I study hard and get all A’s, I can study in a private school for girls where they teach many languages, including English. From there, if I learned new languages, my brother told me that I could study in other places like America, Turkey, Japan, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America sounded best for me, and I wanted to learn English. That’s when I started wishing, and then my wish turned into a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother and I planned my future. He told me that I need to improve myself in any possible way. He even said to me that I need to learn to play komuz, a traditional Kyrgyz instrument. If I study in another country, I can show my talent, and I need to represent my country. So, I started going to music school when I was ten years old. I also transferred to another middle school, which is a Russian school in the city of Batken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had only one school in the village, and it was in the Kyrgyz language. As we wished and planned, I studied hard and passed the entrance exam to a private girls’ high school in the state of Osh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a little bit of a hard time since the private school was out of my father’s budget, but I was so stubborn to go there. My two older brothers also went to that kind of private school, but it wasn’t a problem since they were boys, and they would support their own family in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For me, it was the opposite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be fine if I get a regular education since I am a girl. We had that stereotype that girls don’t need to be smart or get a higher quality education since they will get married and leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the way girls were raised was different from boys. I remember that my mom would always tell me to learn cooking, cleaning, baking, babysitting, and house chores since I will get married one day and it would be a shame for her and me if I didn’t know how to do those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told that if only I could somehow finish high school, maybe college and successfully get married and raise my kids, that’s all that matters, but for me life was more than that. Life has to be more than just being able to get married and raise kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I put an ultimatum to my parents that I will either go to study in that private school and get a good quality education, or I won’t study at all and just stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my family agreed to send me to that girls’ school, and I learned English, Turkish, Russian, and Kyrgyz. Also, I kept going to music school. After high school, my brother helped me to apply to college in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dream turned into a wish, the wish into a plan, the plan into action, and my dream came true, and I began to study in college in Dallas, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started at Richland College, I was so excited, but I also was homesick and had culture shock. In my first week of ESOL (English as a Second Language) class, the dean of ESOL, Diana Urrutia, came to our class, introduced herself, and asked us our names and our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I said Kyrgyzstan, she said that there is an ESOL teacher called Alice Lee, who had been in my country. Later in the lab class, she was introduced to me, and I was so happy that I met one of my people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice went to Kyrgyzstan back in 1999-2001 with the Peace Corps, where she taught English in a small village in the state of Issyk-Kul. I believe we were destined to meet, and I am still so thankful that I met her. She was a huge supporter for me in my hardest days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understood what she had been through in Kyrgyzstan, and she understood what I was going through at that time. She knew how important it was for me to get an education as a girl because she knew how women were treated back in my country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice and I even talked about the “Bride Kidnapping” in my country and how young girls can be victims of that tradition. I also came from a family where my sister was kidnapped twice and forced to marry a guy whom she never talked to before, only because of harsh societal judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some very important events in my Richland College life are that I was finally able to represent my country and play komuz in the intercultural festival day. Another important thing is that Alice and I signed a paper, requesting to set up a peace pole, with the saying “Дуйнодо тынчтык болсун” which means “May peace be on earth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/friendsofkyrgyzstan/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_690/https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-peace-pole.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/friendsofkyrgyzstan/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_290/https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-peace-pole.jpg 290w, https://res.cloudinary.com/friendsofkyrgyzstan/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_423/https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-peace-pole.jpg 423w, https://res.cloudinary.com/friendsofkyrgyzstan/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_556/https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-peace-pole.jpg 556w, https://res.cloudinary.com/friendsofkyrgyzstan/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_639/https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-peace-pole.jpg 639w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 50rem) 50rem, 90vw&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height=&quot;852&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that “Дуйнодо тынчтык болсун” is a very hot and active topic nowadays in the year 2020 where everything is turned upside down in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richland College has an intercultural festival day on behalf of international students, and every year, they put up a peace pole in English and three other languages. It was Alice’s idea, and we made it real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my associate degree at Richland College and got a full-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. It was another challenge for me because it was a super expensive private school in the Dallas area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I love challenges because I get stronger when I overcome them, SMU was tough for me, but I was tougher than SMU since I had already come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice helped me with buying my books and became my American mother and supporter. I finally graduated and got my degree in Accounting and am now working in Crypto Accounting in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so proud of how far I have come and how much I have achieved. Of course, with the support of my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous Kyrgyz writer Chyngyz Aitmatov said: “Ааламга сапар айылдан башталат” which means, “a journey to the world or universe will start from a village.” Aitmatov said that and, I lived that quote in real life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>astrarakhmatillakyzy</name></author><category term="RPCV" /><category term="K-6" /><category term="Guest Post" /><summary type="html">This is the story of a girl from Kyrgyzstan who wanted to see the world.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-astra.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/assets/images/2020/07/astras-story-astra.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to cook rainbow trout Kyrgyz style</title><link href="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/how-to-cook-rainbow-trout" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to cook rainbow trout Kyrgyz style" /><published>2020-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-07-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/how-to-cook-rainbow-trout</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.friendsofkyrgyzstan.org/how-to-cook-rainbow-trout">&lt;p&gt;So, I had planned to make shashlik. Though I am a pescatarian, it’s a dish I prepare for my family of avid meat-eaters. When I went to the store, they only had one leg of lamb that was large enough to feed us for a week. Hesitating, I continued shopping.  I decided to save shashlik for another day when I walked through the seafood section, and the rainbow trout caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fish is a bit more common now in Kyrgyzstan, back in the late ’90s, it was rare unless you went fishing and caught it yourself. There are certainly no national dishes that feature fish. But for me-trout triggers a good memory specific to my experience there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many hours into a trip from Kyzyl-Kiya in the south to Bishkek by car (15 hours trip in total), after seeing green valleys, dusty dry foothills, the lake with the reflection of the mountains like a postcard picture, and snow-lined river banks, somewhere high in the mountains where the road runs along the Abla and then the Kara Balta rivers, we stopped for dinner of river trout. Not only was the break welcome, but so was the fish. I hadn’t had any in what seemed like forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been many years, and I don’t have the recipe. But, considering the simple, clean ingredients that make up the Kyrgyz recipes, I’ve tried to recreate it, keeping it simple with salt, pepper, red pepper, garlic, coriander or cumin (depending on what you like). Coriander will give the fish that shashlik-like flavor. Cumin should be used sparingly, or it can overpower. You can substitute powdered, but be careful not to add too much. As another alternative, place a couple of sprigs of fresh cilantro (kinza) and onion slices in the cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skewer the fish or place into a fish grill grate. This depends on what you are comfortable with and what you are grilling on. I don’t have a mangal, so my trusty gas grill served the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the same as eating in the dark of night at an outdoor table with other road trippers, and the river rushing sounds below. But it is tasty and takes me back in time. What dish transports you back in time to an iconic moment you had in Kyrgyzstan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Salt to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pepper to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 clove garlic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red pepper flakes/crushed to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coriander seeds or cumin seeds to taste&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skewer or fish grate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean the fish of scales and clean the cavity. Clean the inside cavity. Rinse and pat dry. (Tip: by it cleaned and prepped from the store.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut a clove of garlic in half and rub cut end over surface and cavity of fish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Season outside and cavity with salt, pepper, red pepper.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crush the coriander or cumin in your hand to bring out the flavor. Sprinkle inside and out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gently skewer the fish to keep it together and allow you to turn it easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need oil since the fish has natural oils. But you know your grill and your tastes. Feel free to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add to a hot grill for a few minutes on each side until grilled perfectly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plate, squeeze fresh lemon on top, and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washing your hands is one of the best ways to protect yourself from the coronavirus. Lately, we have forgotten the rules of proper hand washing, in other words, we seem to wash less now than in the beginning of quarantine. It is important to note that our hands are one of the most common ways the virus is spread from person to person. One of the simplest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of the virus is to wash your hands with soap. Let’s take care of our health together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this video, take a 30-second video with your child, sister or brother, use the hashtag #koldujuu and upload it to your page, using proper hand washing techniques. Whoever’s video is interesting, original and useful will win a prize from us. Let’s go, then, combine healthy and pleasant work and stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the help making this and contributing voices, FLEX KG Community and The Luciana Malana Board!&lt;/p&gt;

Exactly. Well, if you have been paying attention to my writings the last years then you will recall that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judsonlmoore.com/categories/#jobs/peace-corps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I served in the US Peace Corps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2011-2013 in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan is a gorgeous and remote country in the heart of Central Asia. Europeans who visit the country refer to it as &lt;strong&gt;the Switzerland of Central Asia&lt;/strong&gt;. The history of the country is steeped in nomadic traditions, and it was once a major route along the Silk Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time there, I came to truly love the country and adore its people and culture. I had not been back since the end of my service over 4 years ago, so it was now &lt;em&gt;high-time that I make it back that way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Peace Corps, we don’t really expect that we will ever understand the full breadth or impact of the work we do. This is especially true of the organization’s roots over 50 years ago. Even so, there are &lt;strong&gt;well-documented cases of the ripple effect Peace Corps Volunteers&lt;/strong&gt; have made around the world, sometimes in the most unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reuniting with friends and colleagues this last week, I learned a few things which I did not know about my own legacy in Kyrgyzstan. Some of these I suspected, while others were &lt;strong&gt;a complete shock&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;250000-readers-and-growing&quot;&gt;250,000 readers and growing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial assignment with the Peace Corps was in the remote western province of Kyrgyzstan called Talas, where I worked with Central Asia’s &lt;strong&gt;premier community radio station&lt;/strong&gt;. I did some basic programming work with them and worked out some best-practices on their blog. Moreover, I worked with them to provide trainings to other up-and-coming community radio stations around Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few months of this, &lt;strong&gt;I started to get an idea&lt;/strong&gt;. I observed that many of the eager people we were training in radio broadcast journalism did not have radio stations to return home to, and the prospects of those being built anytime soon seemed quite low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it was obvious that nearly everyone in Kyrgyzstan had a smartphone and was keeping in touch with the news and their friends via phone apps. Therefore, I came up with the idea that &lt;strong&gt;we should provide phones and an online platform&lt;/strong&gt; to these journalists so that they could publish stories today, while they continue to progress toward building a radio station tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kyrgyzmedia.kg/&quot;&gt;kyrgyzmedia.kg&lt;/a&gt; was born in 2013 and now reaches &lt;strong&gt;more than 120,000 readers&lt;/strong&gt; each year all around the world. A remarkable achievement for these journalists who all come from rural parts of Kyrgyzstan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I couldn’t be prouder&lt;/strong&gt; that this project’s origins are from an idea that I had and fought for, wrote the original project plan for and even secured the first rounds of funding for. However, the success and achievements are, and always have been, with the journalists who are utilizing the technology to tell their story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;strong&gt;I was afforded the opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; to present this history and success to the journalists at a media conference in Bishkek, where I was a guest of the conference at the invitation of Deutsche Welle. I am eternally grateful to their support of the project, and of course to the journalists who saw value in this concept and who have owned it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improvements-in-medical-facilities&quot;&gt;Improvements in medical facilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, just before my first departure from Kyrgyzstan in 2013, &lt;strong&gt;my appendix decided it was time to leave my body&lt;/strong&gt;. I had an emergency appendectomy in Kyrgyzstan and it was not a fun experience at all. In fact, it was downright terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer &lt;strong&gt;constrained to a hospital bed&lt;/strong&gt; for a week, I did just what you might expect and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judsonlmoore.com/appendectomy-in-bishkek&quot;&gt;documented the whole experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my writing, I strived to compliment the skills and achievement of the medical teams, who were indeed great. However, they had very limited resources to work with. The purpose of my article was more to shine a light on the awful conditions of Kyrgyzstan’s top surgical center in hopes that it might be &lt;strong&gt;a contributing factor to future improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. My article was even &lt;a href=&quot;https://kloop.kg/blog/2013/04/29/kak-amerikanets-perezhil-appenditsit-v-bishkeke&quot;&gt;translated into Russian and posted on the local news site, Kloop Media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, my old doctor shared with me the news that &lt;strong&gt;something indeed did happen&lt;/strong&gt; as a result of my reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The son of a Kyrgyz parliamentarian read the article and showed it to his father, urging that these conditions were a shame and that the country should address them. After all, Kyrgyzstan certainly has &lt;strong&gt;the resources to do better&lt;/strong&gt;. As the English idiom goes, “the squeaky wheel gets the grease,” and it would appear that my article was a pretty loud squeak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have now learned, is that this started a wave on which enough support was gained to make &lt;strong&gt;serious improvements&lt;/strong&gt; to the country’s medical facilities. Just last month, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vb.kg/doc/367922_atambaev:_narody_nyjno_sozdat_dostoynye_ysloviia_dlia_polycheniia_medpomoshi.html&quot;&gt;a state of the art oncology center was opened in Bishkek&lt;/a&gt;. As for the surgical center where I received treatment, it has also seen a facelift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only dreaming that by sharing my experiences, I could make some impact at all on the Kyrgyz health care system. To learn that now a whole new hospital has been built on the support which my article played a part in forming is one of &lt;strong&gt;the most remarkable things&lt;/strong&gt; I have ever come to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;students-attending-university&quot;&gt;Students attending university&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brilliant university student&lt;/strong&gt; named Meerim once asked me to help her with a summer camp for students in the 15-16 year age range. The problem is that the students would be from an area of Kyrgyzstan which was off-limits for me to travel to. As a workaround solution, Meerim packed up all the students and brought them to me, in Bishkek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 20 students attended. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judsonlmoore.com/bishkek-ict-training&quot;&gt;For my part of the camp&lt;/a&gt;, we had two objectives: expose the students to basic computer skills, especially that of using Excel and understanding budgets, and also to expose them to universities in Bishkek. The hope was that we might &lt;strong&gt;inspire some of the students&lt;/strong&gt; to consider applying for university when they finished their primary studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The training was lots of fun and the kids grasped all of the concepts just fine. They even seemed to find it all quite interesting. &lt;strong&gt;We toured a wide variety of universities&lt;/strong&gt; ranging from the American university, a Russian university, a design university, and a technical college. We also exposed them to some local entrepreneurs, even gaining a tour of the roasting facility for Central Asia’s finest coffee roaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week, the camp concluded and everyone went home, where &lt;strong&gt;I was never to see the students ever again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I caught up with Meerim and she informed me that &lt;strong&gt;100% of those students&lt;/strong&gt; applied to, and are now attending, university! To top it off, they all got scholarships! This outcome was beyond anyone’s wildest hopes and is a testament to what impact anyone can make in the life of another person, especially if you reach them at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friends-that-are-like-family&quot;&gt;Friends that are like family&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to Bishkek again felt like coming home. As I said earlier, Kyrgyzstan’s geographic beauty is vast, but that wouldn’t matter at all if it weren’t for the people who occupy the space. &lt;strong&gt;I adore them all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At every step, I came to realize that despite my scrappy, unkept, and often dirty appearance as an impoverished Peace Corps Volunteer, that never prevented me from forming relationships with &lt;strong&gt;wonderful people&lt;/strong&gt;, or slowed me down in advancing the goals which I had set for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyrgyzstan empowered me to work hard and to strive for a common good. More importantly, the people worked with me to help me understand how I could &lt;strong&gt;be of service&lt;/strong&gt; to them in a valuable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my story, and so I tell it. But if the legacy is to persevere, it is not because it is mine, but because &lt;strong&gt;it is the collectives&lt;/strong&gt;. None of this could have been done alone and I shy away from taking any amount of credit. I am proud to have been a part of these accomplishments, and I will continue to use my life to serve the community around me. &lt;strong&gt;I hope that you will do the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song, a translated cover of The Kink’s, “Have A Cup of Tea,” was such an anticipated success that these volunteers were requested to perform it on-air during an interview.  Here is the recording of that interview and the new hit single, “Peela Chai Each.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011 Peace Corps will turn 50 and we are already starting to plan! First there will be a “staging” in Washington DC for a long weekend. Then those that can, will travel to Kyrgyzstan for a reunion there. If you are interested in being a part of planning this reunion and what it will entail (service projects, visits to current volunteers, etc.), please let the board know so you can be on the 50th anniversary celebration committee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adopt-a-volunteer-program&quot;&gt;Adopt a volunteer program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Mid-states representative Alice Lee took on a new project. She decided to establish an adopt a volunteer program. The simple idea of the program is to match returned volunteers that want to stay connected with Kyrgyzstan with currently serving volunteers who can benefit from their experience and emergency shipments of Mac and Cheese and good markers. I asked Alice to find me a volunteer to adopt. I wanted to reconnect with my Peace Corps service and help a currently serving volunteer. I remember how happy my days were when I received a care package and how on those days the village seemed a little less cold and bleak and far from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice paired me up with Erin McFee who is serving as a health volunteer in Kochkor, Naryn Oblast. Erin is quite accomplished. She is originally from Connecticut but graduated from Elon University in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her studies, she studied abroad in China, London and Ghana. In Ghana, she interned with an Aids research NGO. Her interest in health issues led her to become a health volunteer. Health volunteers are new in Kyrgyzstan and experiencing some of the same frustrations that were common with the sustainable economic development (SED) volunteers during my service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erin has struggled with not having much to do in her official ‘job’ and with the language barrier. Erin, like many SED volunteers before her, has had to strike out on her own to find ways to bring value to her community. She is teaching English, working with a tourism group, and planning a basketball summer camp for summer 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things stay the same and some things change. Erin seems to have much more reliable and frequent access to the internet and even has a blog, but Peace Corps has established strict guidelines on content so she has to limit access to it. It strikes me how technology is changing Kyrgyzstan, but so many of the basic services we in the west rely upon — plumbing, reliable electricity, decent phone lines are still not there. Cell towers are going up in areas that have never had reliable high quality phone
lines, leap frogging the progression of technology. I am enjoying learning from Erin what things are the same and what has changed. I hope this program grows and more RPCVs can enjoy helping a current volunteer and more current volunteers take advantage of those of us who want to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;congratulations-amy-redwine&quot;&gt;Congratulations Amy Redwine!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us will never know the impact we had on students and colleagues in Kyrgyzstan. That is not the case with K-6, Amy Redwine. Amy made a real commitment to her core group of students and helped them continue their studies with financial and moral support. One of her students, Umut Orozalieva (pictured below), recently graduated from the American University of Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friends-of-kyrgyzstan-on-facebook&quot;&gt;Friends of Kyrgyzstan on Facebook!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a member of the social networking site Facebook? Not only is Facebook a fun way to keep in touch with your RPCV friends but it is now another fundraising opportunity for Friend of Kyrgyzstan.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-grant-to-kind-family-children-home&quot;&gt;Our grant to Kind Family Children Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of Kyrgyzstan recently received the final report on the grant we gave to the Kind Family Children Home for the purchase of farm equipment. The grant we sent was $500 of the total of $7,000 donated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to benefit over 5,000 individuals, most of them orphans. With this investment in farm Equipment, the orphanage will be much more sustainable and less dependent on donations for the basic necessity of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all our members who made donations to this worthy cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are over 1/2 way to making a new grant! Please consider making a donation to help another Peace Corps Volunteer make another dream a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donations can be made out to FOKGZ and mailed to Friends of Kyrgyzstan, 1104 Applebriar Lane, Marlborough, MA 01752.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Brian Cowan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian was a K-11 volunteer who served in Issyk-kul oblast in the Jeti-Ogus rayon village of Orgorchor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian was a TEFL volunteer who used his connections in his native Tennes-see to coordinate a book drive that resulted in 7,100 books being donated to his school in Orgorchor. Brian was also in country during the Tulip revolution and counts this as one of the most interesting parts of his service. Brian is currently living in Boston and has just completed his first year of law school. In addition to being our newly elected President, Brian is working for the New Hampshire Public Defenders Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian says he decided to run for the position of President to “put his money where his mouth is” and put some of the desires he had vocalized to the group as NPCA Liaison into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian’s goals as president include increasing the number of RPCVs who are members of the National Peace Corps Association. Brian also wants FOKGZ to take a more active role in supporting current volunteers in Kyrgyzstan and those nominated to go. Brian also wants to clarify and better articulate the mission of Friends of Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;npca-liaison-julie-lusher-rotherham&quot;&gt;NPCA Liaison Julie Lusher Rotherham&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-5 TEFL volunteer Julie Rotherham served in the city of Kyzul-Kiya in the southern province of Osh. While in Kyrgyzstan, Julie organized and facilitated a democracy conference for 50 teachers. The conference earned the honor of being the first group allowed access to the Kyrgyz Parliament Building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie also fondly remembers teaching baseball, distributing over 500 pairs of eye-glasses, and working with local teachers and motivated students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most RPCV’s Julie also has some sad stories to tell of bride kidnapping and traveling through war torn Tajikistan. These sad stories though are eclipsed by the memories of teaching and friendships with Kyrgyz children. After completing her service Julie worked with American Councils which gave her the opportunity to complete some of her goals that were left unfulfilled. Back in the states Julie has been a teacher at a rural school in central Virginia until recently when she has taken on the role of mother to 15 month old twin girls. Julie is beginning to think that motherhood is truly “the toughest job you’ll ever love.” Julie decided to run for NPCA liaison because she feels strongly that Kyrgyzstan needs support from people, like RPCVs, that truly know and understand the situation there. Julie’s goals as NPCA liaison include increasing awareness of FOKGZ among recently returned volunteers and increasing membership. Julie also looks forward to reconnecting with Peace Corps friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice moved sites mid service due to some strange incidents at her site involving, of curse, sheep’s blood on doors and desks at the school, and a friend’s attack and subsequent hospitalization. (Needless to say it is a long story!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Alice’s biggest accomplishments in Kyrgyzstan was the establishment of an English language resource center in Balykchi. Alice was also the GLOBE program coordinator her second year in Kyrgyzstan and attended a conference in Kiev. Alice also participated in a week –long environmental
camp. Alice now works as an ESOL instructor for Richland College (a recent winner of the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award) in Dallas, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fokgz-gives-500-grant-to-the-kind-family-children-home&quot;&gt;FOKGZ Gives $500 Grant to the Kind Family Children Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FOKGZ board recently voted to give a grant of $500 to a Peace Corps Partnership Project submitted by Peach Corps Volunteer B. Parker from Colorado. The project has been fully funded and is now being implemented!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the description of the project that was submitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind Family Children Home was created by two families in August, 2004 out of the need to help the homeless children they saw in their community. Currently, Kind Family Children Home houses 27 children and is only able to grow a small percentage of their own food for feeding their children and livestock and thus rely on both food and monetary donations to further cover these needs. They realize that dependence on outside sources is not sustainable and can be unreliable and thus they desire to be self-sufficient. The goal of this project is to increase productivity and self-sufficiency, through the purchase of a tractor, trailer, plough and mower. Kind Family Children Home requests the assistance of the Partnership Program to assist them in purchasing the farming equipment which will allow them to farm the 6 hectares of fallow land they own, but can not currently cultivate due to lack of resources. This project will directly affect the children of the orphanage the most, as they will have more and a greater variety of food to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Kind Family Children Home will rent the farm equipment to local community members as Semyonovka Village currently does not have any farming equipment at its disposal. This will provide income generation for Kind Family Children Home to maintain the farming equipment and purchase other necessary items for the children, while providing a much needed service in the community. FOKGZ supported this program through the Peach Corps Partnership Program. The Peace Corps Partnership Program (PCPP) connects small, community-initiated projects with partners in the United States for financial support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These connections not only achieve goals in the host community, improving the quality of life for its members, but they foster international understanding between the communities and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 1964, the Partnership Program has assisted thousands of Peace Corps Volunteers, in every Peace Corps country, in order to benefit the health and well-being of their host com-
munities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Peace Corps Partnership Program visit them on the web at http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.donors The Friends of Kyrgyzstan board would like to thank all the members who donated to FOKGZ to make this grant and our continued work possible! Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ever-wonder-what-it-would-be-like-to-live-in-kyrgyzstan-again&quot;&gt;Ever Wonder What It Would Be Like to Live in Kyrgyzstan Again?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Tiffany Tuttle, K-6, Osh and Issyk-Kul&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phrase I said in Kyrgyz after four years away was, “Menin sumkam kelgen jok.”  (My bag hasn’t come yet.)  This was not a surprise to me, since I had flown with Horizon air from Seattle to Los Angeles, and then switched to Aeroflot from LA to Moscow, and Moscow to Bishkek.  I had packed all the essentials in my carry-ons:  my camera, laptop, a change of clothes, my toothbrush and basic toiletries, a water filter, and library books on the anthropology of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to being back in Kyrgyzstan was like coming home to someplace whose little quirks I knew well but needed to remind myself about.  Oh yeah, the wall switches are on the left of the door at shoulder-height.  Right, the toilet paper goes in the trash, not the toilet.  Need to remember to pick up a kepetilnik for heating bath water when I see a bazaar…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of things that I could still say in Kyrgyz and Russian, but there was a whole lot more that people could say to me that I couldn’t understand.  I had also misplaced my mental map of Bishkek – I spent the first several days wandering around, either walking in the wrong direction for hours and then surrendering and taking a taxi home, or taking marshrutkas on crazy rides all over the place, hopping from one to the next in the hopes that I would get to somewhere I recognized.  I hadn’t planned on spending a week in Bishkek, but it was actually an unexpected blessing, since it gave me time to regroup and orient myself in a town where a mix of Russian, Kyrgyz, and English could get me by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the Volunteers who was moved up from the south when the problems in Batken began in 1999, and my time in the Peace Corps had been a little rocky.  I had made arrangements with the Peace Corps to leave my village to head up the GLOBE ecology program in Jalal-Abad, a difficult decision made even more difficult by my host family’s failure to understand why I was leaving.  Then, during what should have been my transition, I was evacuated with the other southern Volunteers and relocated to Balikchi.  I never saw my host family again.  My time in Balikchi had been marked by professional frustration, both with GLOBE and the Fund Meerim center where I was working, and because my time was short and other PCV’s were plentiful I made few attempts to integrate into my new community.  After COS, I struggled with whether or not my second year had been served well, whether or not I had made any impact.  Hearing that the struggling GLOBE program collapsed under my successor, Alice Tyler (now  Moy), despite all her valiant efforts did not assuage my doubts.  Now I was back, and a bit leery of opening old wounds by traveling back to my old haunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-years-for-a-t-shirt&quot;&gt;Four Years for a T-shirt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Matt Cain, K-9, Talas and Karakol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge offered his hand and apologies for the actions of misguided youth. The defense lawyer told me I taught English to her daughter and invited me to dinner with her family. The two young men accused of theft and assaulting me stood nearby, watching and listening. They must have been adding up the odds against them, measuring their bad luck. Whatever they had intended, it wasn’t this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened July 4th late at night. I was walking home from West Café along Toktogul Street. The beers I drank weighed heavily and I decided to find a tree since it was another 10 minutes until home. Slipping into the shadows and doing my business, two men came toward me. I got myself proper and tried to walk past them out of the shadows and into the street. They grabbed me, saying nothing, pulling me back into the shadows. Turned around, with my back toward the street, I tried talking to them and yanking free of their grip. They kept pulling and eventually I was bent over and one had grabbed the collar and back of my shirt. We struggled in this way for a few moments until I figured if I wiggled a bit, my shirt would come off in their hands and I could escape. They yanked my shirt off and I moved out into the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bare chested, fear replaced by anger, I demanded they give me the shirt and t-shirt back. I tried first in Russian, but who knows what I actually said. They looked a bit puzzled. Finally I yelled and cursed them in English. This caught their attention. The shorter and rounder of the two stopped picking up the cigarettes spilled out of my shirt pocket, got my shirt, folded it nicely and handed it back while bowing with his right hand over his heart. He then took off toward a car waiting a little ways down the street. The other one remained, t-shirt in hand and flashed a badge. He beckoned me to him. I refused to leave the relative safety of the road, where I was trying to flag down passing cars. I flashed him my Peace Corps wallet and motioned for him to come out into the lighted street. He refused and after a moment, walked to the car, taking my t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I went to the militia headquarters with a friend to file a report. After getting passed from officer to officer, all looking somewhat puzzled and amused as the story was told, and writing the story three times, I went home thinking that was the end of it. Next morning, the militia summoned me to identify suspects. When I arrive, I’m taken into a small room where a t-shirt lies on a table. They ask if it is mine. It is. How do I know? It has the deodorant rings in the armpit. They get a good laugh when I explain, then they escort me into another room where five men are lined up against the wall. Do I recognize any of them? One of them is a militia officer who took my written report the day before. Another is an old man, still drunk from the night before and offering to shake my hand. The third a man I’d never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two, heads down, beltless and without shoelaces, resembled the two who grabbed me. I wasn’t sure, but it wasn’t the other three. The officer in charge didn’t need to hear anything more and pulled the two young men into the other room with the t-shirt, had them lean over the table, and took a Polaroid of them with the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They assigned me a lawyer which led to more reports. One meeting involved me and my program manager Rashid, who was now my official translator, sitting in a small room in militia headquarters, with my lawyer at a small table across from us. Next to me the two accused of attacking me waited for the questioning. During breaks they asked for cigarettes and told me they meant it only as a joke. And that I shouldn’t be out alone after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I thought this meeting couldn’t get more bizarre, in came a high ranking officer and three others. They sat on the other side of the room, the officer behind a small table and the others on the bench that extended down from where I sat with my crew. The officer began questioning one of the young men, loud enough for our group to stop what we were doing to listen. I couldn’t understand what they were saying, but a young man began crying, saying over and over he had been drunk and didn’t remember anything. Rashid translated the rest for me. The young man was accused of beating another man to death with repeated blows to the head with a rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Amy Redwine, K-6, International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with a promise. A promise to Rahat’s mother that I would somehow find a way to get him to the United States to study. I was apprehensive about that promise, not sure how I was going to keep my end of the deal, but when I got back home after 2 ½ years in Kyrgyzstan, I had to try. I asked my family for help getting him to the US and they were all very supportive. During the process of enrolling him at my old alma mater, I was given not one, but two slots for exchange students and thus, Alina ended up in the US, too, for the 2001-2002 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2002, I decided to go to Kyrgyzstan for a visit. It was wonderful and everything was pretty much as I remembered it. I had taken my video camera and when I got back, my family actually wanted to watch all 18 hours or so of video. There, they saw my kids for the first time. My mother fell in love with one in particular, Lena. She became determined to get Lena in school as, at the time, she was still in the village helping her grandparents milk cows, though her heart was absolutely set on studying at American University of Kyrgyzstan. My mother raised the money for her tuition within 12 hours of sending a group mail to all her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing led to another and we couldn’t help Lena if we weren’t helping this one and that one. Now, we are helping 11 of my former students from the village in varying degrees. Mostly we are helping them to get through school, but we have also been helping some of the women in my village by ordering Kyrgyz handicrafts from them and selling them to people in the US. ½ of the profits go to helping the kids with tuition and the other half goes to the women. We have also set up a mini-Heifer Project and have given 8 cows to needy families in my village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This endeavor has been of no small sacrifice to anyone, not least my family, who continue to support my cause because they know how much it means to me and more importantly, they know how much it means to the kids. We are helping these young adults become important and productive citizens of Kyrgyzstan and the world, and that is worth the sacrifice every time.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2004 FOKGZ made the transition from a list serve of loosely connected returned and current volunteers to a not-for-profit organization with a definite structure and defined goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2004 FOKGZ became incorporated as a charitable organization in the state of New York. We also established an EIN tax identification number with the IRS and our treasurer, Brandon Boyle, set up a bank account for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March of 2004 FOKGZ became an official affiliate of the National Peace Corps Association. We also applied for and received a $200 grant to enable us to establish a website for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugh Ho began work on the website in the spring and was able to launch the site live shortly before the National Peace Corps Association conference in August. The site has been a wonderful addition to FOKGZ as it gives us an official presence. Being a
geographically diverse group FOKGZ needed to have a website to achieve a real sense of legitimacy and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPCA and Friends of Kyrgyzstan member Melissa Morgan organized a reunion dinner During the National Peace Corps Association conference in Chicago. The dinner was a huge success and helped get some of the earlier volunteers more actively involved in the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2004 FOKGZ started working with a lawyer located by member Neil Berkowitz on the paperwork need for establishing federal not for profit 501 C 3 status with the federal government. Neil Petty our lawyer that is donating his time has been a
great benefit to the group and has helped us clarify our goals and objectives. Also in the fall FOKGZ unfortunately lost contact with our newsletter editor but was lucky to have Becca Ripley offer to assume the place and FOKGZ is eagerly waiting for the first newsletter release in early March 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2004-year was a very productive year in getting established as an organization but FOKGZ had a slow year in terms of charitable projects. FOKGZ sent the last boxes of donated clothing from the 2003 clothing drive to the Center for the Protection of Children
and the Babushka Adoption in Bishkek. Individual members solicited help from people in the group but FOKGZ did not directly sponsor any projects this year. FOKGZ is organizing a fundraising committee and hopes to be able to fund some projects in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>fokgz</name></author><category term="501c3" /><summary type="html">This year has been a very important year for the Friends of Kyrgyzstan (FOKGZ).
