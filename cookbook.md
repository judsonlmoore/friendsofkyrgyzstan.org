Guests will place their meat atop the noodles and usually eat from a communal dish by hand.

Sift flour and salt into large bowl and make a well in center. Pour egg and 1⁄4 cup water into center of flour. Mix with hands, adding water by the tbs until dough forms but is not sticky. Knead 3 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes. Roll into long, thin noodles, adding more flour if necessary. Remove mutton from pot or kazan. Drop noodles into mutton stock and cook until just tender, about 2 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Place noodles in deep dish with stock. Top with mutton and serve.

5 cups uzgen rice  
5 tsp salt  
1⁄4- 1⁄2 cup sunflower oil  
1⁄2 cup diced carrots, onions and peppers  
2 legs of chicken, broken down into thighs, wings, etc. 6 cloves garlic, peeled  
1⁄2 raisins  
1 pinapple, chopped (optional)  
1⁄4 cup maple syrup or honey  
1 bay leaf

Soak rice in salt water for 2 hours. Fill large pot with 2-3 centimeters with oil. Heat on high, add carrots, onions, peppers and chicken. Let soak in oil for 15 minutes until browed and cooked almost all the way through (chicken is no longer bloody). Drain uncooked rice and add so it’s covering all ingredients. Add whole cloves of a garlic and golden raisins. Add pineapple (if using) and maple syrup or honey. Add cold water so rice is covered and bay leaf. Cover and don’t stir for 10 minutes. At this point, rice and cloves should be getting soft. Stab into rice with fork and cover and simmer for another 10 minutes. Serve hot.

Самсы — Samsa
-------------

(8 servings)  
2 cups of flour  
1 egg  
Melted butter  
2 onions, finely chopped  
crushed red pepper (kalimpir)  
3 – 4 cups ground beef or mutton 10 cloves garlic, finely chopped  
Salt  
Black pepper

Dissolve 2 tbs salt in warm water. Beat egg and mix with flour. Gradually add the salt water to the flour until the dough holds together and doesn‘t stick. Set aside in a covered bowl for 20 minutes. Mix meat, onions, garlic, salt, black pepper and kalimpir together. Roll the dough out into a large disk about 1⁄4-inch thick. Spread a thin layer of butter onto disk, and then roll up into a long tube (as if you were making cinnamon rolls). Cut tube into 3 inch sections, and roll each out with a rolling pin. Each section should be an 1⁄8 to 1⁄4-inch thick. This will create fine layers in the pastry. Put 1-2 tbs of the meat mixture onto the dough and fold opposite ends together to make a little triangle package. Repeat with remaining sections of dough. Bake on a greased cookie dough sheet at medium heat for 40-50 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through and the dough is brown.

Шашлык — Shashlik
-----------------

(6 servings)  
1 kilo chicken, pork or beef  
Shashlik or Roast Chicken seasoning packet  
1 bottle of kefir  
shashlik accoutrement (pokers, grill, fire, etc.)

Cut the meat into medium-sized to bite-sized chunks. Put them in a large bowl and add the spices and Kefir. Let the meat marinate for two to four hours. Then fill as many shashlik pokers as you have meat. Shashlik is best cooked over coals. Feel free to make them more like shish-kabobs, adding vegetables or fruits. Serves well over rice.
