Recipes come from the collections of Peace Corps Volunteers and Kyrgyz Nationals who have graciously hosted us and fed us. Be adventurous. Stock up on spices you‘ve never tried before. Watch your host mother make plov. Buy that strange looking vegetable. Buy an oven. Experiment! Make the most of the incredibly delicious and abundant produce available in Kyrgyzstan – the most delicious fruits and vegetables abound in the summer, and canning is a great way to keep the momentum going through the winter. Play around with these recipes, develop a personal style, and stay healthy (or at least, satisfied) during your service! Bon appétit!</p><p><a class="btn btn-primary mr-3 mb-2" href="http://localhost:4000/assets/docs/peace-corps-kyrgyzstan-cookbook-2012.pdf" target="_blank" role="button">Download Complete Cookbook</a></p><p><em>This edition was edited by Stephanie Smith and Lola Dupuy (K-18‘s).</em></p><h2 id="окрошка-akroshka-cold-kefir-soup">Окрошка — Akroshka (Cold Kefir Soup)</h2><p>(6 servings)<br /> 2 bottles kefir<br /> 2 – 3 cooked potatoes, diced<br /> 6 radishes, sliced<br /> 3 medium sized tomatoes, chopped<br /> 4 cucumbers, diced<br /> 1 cup diced ham or sausage (optional) 1⁄2 – 1 cup chopped dill or cilantro<br /> Mix all ingredients and serve.</p><h2 id="борщ--borscht-beet-soup">Борщ — Borscht (Beet Soup)</h2><p>(6 servings) For veggie Borscht, leave out beef. 1⁄2 kilo beef, cut into chunks<br /> 1 tbs of sunflower oil<br /> 1⁄2 kilogram raw beets, peeled and grated 2 carrots, finely chopped<br /> 1 large onion, finely chopped<br /> 1 garlic clove, crushed<br /> 1⁄4 head of cabbage, finely chopped 1 basil leaf<br /> 5 cups stock<br /> 2 – 3 tsp lemon juice</p><p>Salt and pepper to taste<br /> 2/3 cup sour cream, to serve</p><p>Cover beef chunks with flower, cook in oil until evenly browned.
