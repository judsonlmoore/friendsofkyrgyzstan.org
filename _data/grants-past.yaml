The tractor will also be rented to community members and proceeds from that will be used to for fuel and maintanece of the tractor.

  description: There will be two ToTs this fall, both for 20 PCV/CP teams, one will train the trainers in how to conduct a nutrition club for young women/new moms. The second will focus on the same target audience, but train the trainers how to hold fitness clubs in their communities. Ideally, this will turn into an annual series of trainings. To kick off the first year of the Fitness Education ToT, the third day of the training will be a 5k/10k race at the Cholpon-Ata Hippodrome to raise awareness about the importance of physical fitness in maintaining healthy lifestyles.  JICA recently held an international friendship marathon in Cholpon-Ata and the local turnout was impressive.  We're hoping to have the same success, though on a smaller scale, with our run!
