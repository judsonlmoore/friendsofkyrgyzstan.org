### Friends of Kyrgyzstan Volunteer Sponsorship Grant

Friends of Kyrgyzstan is calling all currently serving Peace Corps Volunteers in Kyrgyzstan to apply to the Friends of Kyrgyzstan Volunteer Sponsorship Grant.

The Friends of Kyrgyzstan Sponsorship Grant is supported by private donations made by Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and other donors.

Friends of Kyrgyzstan hopes to provide more Peace Corps volunteers in Kyrgyzstan with more opportunities to access grants and to share these experiences amongst members and other interested parties. Grant funding will focus on projects that improve the volunteer’s local community. Special focus will be placed on projects that impact a large number of people, create sustainable impact, and can demonstrate a perceived need and local support.

Projects may be funded by a Friends of Kyrgyzstan Volunteer Sponsorship Grant in amounts up $500. Grant Proposals should be submitted to friendsofkyrgyzstan@yahoo.com by August 31, 2016. All questions may also be directed at friendsofkyrgyzstan@gmail.com by August 31, 2016.

### Grant must include the following:

**Cover Sheet including:**

  - Name
  - Site
  - Contact info. (Email, Physical Address if Applicable)
  - Project Name
  - Project Description
  - Project Timeline
  - Amount requested

**Grant Proposal Including:**

- Executive summary (1 paragraph long)
- Description of need/problem to be solved with grant
- Goals that will be achieved
- Proposed deliverables
- Credentials and names of those involved in overseeing the project (volunteer, counterpart, etc.)
- Describe your plan for either continuing your project or closing out your grant in the unexpected case of evacuation or change of permanent site
- Budget
- Budget narrative (optional/include if further explanation of budget line items is needed)

**The grant should not exceed 5 pages including cover page and budget.**

Grants will be reviewed by the Friends of Kyrgyzstan Board and recipients will be notified by September 30.

**Please note:** Volunteers with active grants at the time of COS will be required to notify Friends of Kyrgyzstan of their upcoming departure two months in advance. At this time, they will be expected to furnish Friends of Kyrgyzstan with a progress report on their grant project. If Friends of Kyrgyzstan deems the project has met all the goals stated in the proposal, we will officially close the grant and consider it successfully completed. If, however, the project is not completed at the time of a volunteer’s COS and not all the funds have not been spent, the volunteer must provide Friends of Kyrgyzstan with a plan as to who will continue the work after they have left. This person will be responsible for continuously communicating with Friends of Kyrgyzstan until the project has successfully finished. Ultimately, volunteers who have not spent all their grant funds will be required to return unspent money to Friends of Kyrgyzstan, along with a project report recapping what was accomplished with spent funds and a reason why there is unspent grant money along with a description of what was not completed as a result.
