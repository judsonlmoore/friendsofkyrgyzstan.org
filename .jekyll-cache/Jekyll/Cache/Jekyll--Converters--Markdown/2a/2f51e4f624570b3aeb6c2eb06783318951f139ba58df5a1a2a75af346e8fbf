<p>Cooking in Kyrgyzstan can be an all-day adventure: procuring ingredients at the hectic bazaars, finagling substitutions for American ingredients, sniffing at things to ascertain their freshness, and then the massive task of putting food together in hap-hazard kitchens where svet jok and cyy jok often spice up the process‚Ä¶ but don‚Äòt be defeated, cooking for yourself is a great way to maintain control of your diet, to unwind after a long day at work, or to learn a skill you might not have honed of in America.</p>

<p>These recipes are made from local ingredients, with plausible substitutions suggested where necessary. Recipes come from the collections of Peace Corps Volunteers and Kyrgyz Nationals who have graciously hosted us and fed us. Be adventurous. Stock up on spices you‚Äòve never tried before. Watch your host mother make plov. Buy that strange looking vegetable. Buy an oven. Experiment! Make the most of the incredibly delicious and abundant produce available in Kyrgyzstan ‚Äì the most delicious fruits and vegetables abound in the summer, and canning is a great way to keep the momentum going through the winter. Play around with these recipes, develop a personal style, and stay healthy (or at least, satisfied) during your service! Bon app√©tit!</p>

<p>(12 servings)<br />
This dish is translated literally as ‚Äïfive fingers‚Äñ because it‚Äòs traditionally eaten by hand and served for guests. The meat is brought out first and several guests will slice it.

These dumplings can be filled with diced pumpkin or potatoes if you‚Äòd like. You‚Äòll need a tiered steamer, made of bamboo or aluminum, which is available at most bazaars.</p>

<h2 id="rainbow-trout">Rainbow trout</h2>

<p>While fish is a bit more common now in Kyrgyzstan, back in the late 90‚Äôs, it was rare unless you went fishing and caught it yourself. There are certainly no national dishes that feature fish. But for me-trout triggers a good memory specific to my experience there.</p>

<h2 id="–ø–ª–æ–≤--plov">–ü–ª–æ–≤ ‚Äî Plov</h2>

1‚ÅÑ2 kilogram carrots, julienne<br />
4 cups water<br />
3 garlic cloves, whole<br />
1‚ÅÑ2 kilogram of rice, cleaned and soaked for 30 minutes (uzgen rice for best quality)</p>

<h2 id="–ø–ª–æ–≤--southern-plov">–ü–ª–æ–≤ ‚Äî Southern Plov</h2>

<p>5 cups uzgen rice<br />
5 tsp salt<br />
1‚ÅÑ4- 1‚ÅÑ2 cup sunflower oil<br />
1‚ÅÑ2 cup diced carrots, onions and peppers<br />
2 legs of chicken, broken down into thighs, wings, etc. 6 cloves garlic, peeled<br />
1‚ÅÑ2 raisins<br />
1 pinapple, chopped (optional)<br />
1‚ÅÑ4 cup maple syrup or honey<br />
1 bay leaf</p>

<p>Soak rice in salt water for 2 hours. Fill large pot with 2-3 centimeters with oil. Heat on high, add carrots, onions, peppers and chicken. Let soak in oil for 15 minutes until browed and cooked almost all the way through (chicken is no longer bloody). Drain uncooked rice and add so it‚Äôs covering all ingredients. Add whole cloves of a garlic and golden raisins. Add pineapple (if using) and maple syrup or honey. Add cold water so rice is covered and bay leaf. Cover and don‚Äôt stir for 10 minutes.

<h2 id="—Å–∞–º—Å—ã--samsa">–°–∞–º—Å—ã ‚Äî Samsa</h2>

<p>(8 servings)<br />
2 cups of flour<br />
1 egg<br />
Melted butter<br />
2 onions, finely chopped<br />
crushed red pepper (kalimpir)<br />
3 ‚Äì 4 cups ground beef or mutton 10 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br />
Salt<br />
Black pepper</p>

<p>Dissolve 2 tbs salt in warm water. Beat egg and mix with flour. Gradually add the salt water to the flour until the dough holds together and doesn‚Äòt stick. Set aside in a covered bowl for 20 minutes. Mix meat, onions, garlic, salt, black pepper and kalimpir together. Roll the dough out into a large disk about 1‚ÅÑ4-inch thick. Spread a thin layer of butter onto disk, and then roll up into a long tube (as if you were making cinnamon rolls). Cut tube into 3 inch sections, and roll each out with a rolling pin. Each section should be an 1‚ÅÑ8 to 1‚ÅÑ4-inch thick. This will create fine layers in the pastry. Put 1-2 tbs of the meat mixture onto the dough and fold opposite ends together to make a little triangle package. Repeat with remaining sections of dough. Bake on a greased cookie dough sheet at medium heat for 40-50 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through and the dough is brown.</p>

Then fill as many shashlik pokers as you have meat. Shashlik is best cooked over coals. Feel free to make them more like shish-kabobs, adding vegetables or fruits. Serves well over rice.</p>
