I"„<p>So, I had planned to make shashlik. Though I am a pescatarian, itâ€™s a dish I prepare for my family of avid meat-eaters. When I went to the store, they only had one leg of lamb that was large enough to feed us for a week. Hesitating, I continued shopping.  I decided to save shashlik for another day when I walked through the seafood section, and the rainbow trout caught my eye.</p>
