<p><strong>The grant should not exceed 5 pages including cover page and budget.</strong></p>

<p>Grants will be reviewed by the Friends of Kyrgyzstan Board and recipients will be notified by September 30.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Volunteers with active grants at the time of COS will be required to notify Friends of Kyrgyzstan of their upcoming departure two months in advance. At this time, they will be expected to furnish Friends of Kyrgyzstan with a progress report on their grant project. If Friends of Kyrgyzstan deems the project has met all the goals stated in the proposal, we will officially close the grant and consider it successfully completed. If, however, the project is not completed at the time of a volunteerâ€™s COS and not all the funds have not been spent, the volunteer must provide Friends of Kyrgyzstan with a plan as to who will continue the work after they have left. This person will be responsible for continuously communicating with Friends of Kyrgyzstan until the project has successfully finished. Ultimately, volunteers who have not spent all their grant funds will be required to return unspent money to Friends of Kyrgyzstan, along with a project report recapping what was accomplished with spent funds and a reason why there is unspent grant money along with a description of what was not completed as a result.</p>
