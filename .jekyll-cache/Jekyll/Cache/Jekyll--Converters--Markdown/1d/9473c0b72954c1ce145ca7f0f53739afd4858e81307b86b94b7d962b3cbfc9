I"Ó<p>So, I had planned to make shashlik. Though I am pescatarian, itâ€™s a dish I make for my family of avid meat eaters. When I went to the store, they only had one leg of lamb that was large enough to feed us for a week. Hesitating, I continued shopping.  I decided to save shashlik for another day when I walked through the seafood section and the rainbow trout caught my eye.</p>

<p>While fish is a bit more common now in Kyrgyzstan, back in the late 90â€™s, it was rare unless you went fishing and caught it yourself. There are certainly no national dishes that feature fish. But for me-trout triggers a god memory specific to my experience there.</p>

<p>Many hours into a trip from Kyzyl-Kiya in the south to Bishkek by car (15 hours trip in total), after seeing green valleys, dusty dry foothills, the lake with the reflection of the mountains like a postcard picture, and snow-lined river banks, somewhere high in the mountains where the road runs along the Abla and then the Kara Balta rivers, we stopped for dinner of river trout. Not only was the break welcome, fish was welcome. I hadnâ€™t had any in what seemed like forever.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been many years and I donâ€™t have the recipe. But, considering the simple clean ingredients that make up the Kyrgyz recipes, Iâ€™ve tried to recreate it, keeping it simple with salt, pepper, red pepper, garlic, coriander or cumin (depending on what you like). Coriander will give the fish that shashlik-like flavor. Cumin should be used sparingly or it can overpower. You can substitute powdered but be careful not to add too much. As another alternative, place a couple sprigs of fresh cilantro (kinza) it onion slices in the cavity.</p>

<p>Skewer the fish or place into a fish grill grate. This depends on what you are comfortable with and what you are grilling on. I donâ€™t have a mangal so my trusty gas grill served the purpose.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not the same as eating in the dark of night at an outdoor table with other road trippers and the sounds of the river rushing below. But it is tasty and takes me back in time. What dish transports you back in time to an iconic moment you had in Kyrgyzstan?</p>
