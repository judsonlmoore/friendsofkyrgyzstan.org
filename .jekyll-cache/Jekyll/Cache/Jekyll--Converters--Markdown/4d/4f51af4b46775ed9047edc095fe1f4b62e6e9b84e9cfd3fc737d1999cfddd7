<p><strong>President Brian Cowan.</strong></p>

<p>Brian was a K-11 volunteer who served in Issyk-kul oblast in the Jeti-Ogus rayon village of Orgorchor.</p>

<p>Brian was a TEFL volunteer who used</p>

<p>his connections in his native Tennes-
see to coordinate a book drive that</p>

<p>resulted in 7,100 books being donated
to his school in Orgorchor.
Brian was also in country during the</p>

<p>Tulip revolution and counts this as one of the
most interesting parts of his service.
Brian is currently living in Boston and has just</p>

<p>completed his first year of law school. In addi-
tion to being our newly elected President,</p>

<p>Brian is working for the New Hampshire Pub-
lic Defenders Office.</p>

<p>Brian says he decided to run for the position of
President to “put his money where his mouth</p>

<p>is” and put some of the desires he had vocal-
ized to the group as NPCA Liaison into action.</p>

<p>Brian’s goals as president include increasing the
number of RPCVs who are members of the
National Peace Corps Association. Brian also
wants FOKGZ to take a more active role in
supporting current volunteers in Kyrgyzstan
and those nominated to go. Brian also wants
to clarify and better articulate the mission of
Friends of Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<h2 id="npca-liaison-julie-lusher-rotherham">NPCA Liaison Julie Lusher Rotherham</h2>

<p>K-5 TEFL volunteer Julie Rotherham
served in the city of Kyzul-Kiya in the
southern province of Osh.
While in Kyrgyzstan, Julie organized and
facilitated a democracy conference for 50
teachers. The conference earned the honor
of being the first group allowed access to
the Kyrgyz Parliament Building.</p>

<p>Julie also fondly remembers teaching base-
ball, distributing over 500 pairs of eye-
glasses, and working with local teachers</p>

<p>and motivated students.</p>

<p>Like most RPCV’s Julie also has some sad</p>

<p>stories to tell of bride kidnapping and trav-
eling through war torn Tajikistan. These</p>

<p>sad stories though are eclipsed by the
memories of teaching and friendships with
Kyrgyz children.
After completing her service Julie worked
with American Councils which gave her
the opportunity to complete some of her
goals that were left unfulfilled.
Back in the states Julie has been a teacher
at a rural school in central Virginia until
recently when she has taken on the role of
mother to 15 month old twin girls. Julie is
beginning to think that motherhood is
truly “the toughest job you’ll ever love.”
Julie decided to run for NPCA liaison
because she feels strongly that Kyrgyzstan
needs support from people, like RPCVs,</p>

<p>that truly know and understand the situa-
tion there. Julie’s goals as NPCA liaison</p>

<p>include increasing awareness of FOKGZ
among recently returned volunteers and
increasing membership. Julie also looks
forward to reconnecting with Peace Corps
friends.</p>

<h2 id="fokgz-gives-500-grant-to-the-kind-family-children-home">FOKGZ Gives $500 Grant to the Kind Family Children Home</h2>

<p>The FOKGZ board recently voted to
give a grant of $500 to a Peace
Corps Partnership Project submitted
by Peach Corps Volunteer B. Parker
from Colorado. The project has
been fully funded and is now being
implemented!</p>

<p>Below is the description of the pro-
ject that was submitted.</p>

<p>Kind Family Children Home was
created by two families in August,
2004 out of the need to help the
homeless children they saw in their
community. Currently, Kind Family
Children Home houses 27 children</p>

<p>and is only able to grow a small per-
centage of their own food for feed-
ing their children and livestock and</p>

<p>thus rely on both food and monetary
donations to further cover these
needs. They realize that dependence
on outside sources is not sustainable
and can be unreliable and thus they
desire to be self-sufficient. The
goal of this project is to increase
productivity and self-sufficiency,</p>

<p>through the purchase of a tractor,</p>

<p>trailer, plough and mower. Kind Fam-
ily Children Home requests the assis-
tance of the Partnership Program to</p>

<p>assist them in purchasing the farming
equipment which will allow them to
farm the 6 hectares of fallow land they
own, but can not currently cultivate
due to lack of resources.
This project will directly affect the
children of the orphanage the most, as</p>

<p>they will have more and a greater vari-
ety of food to eat. In addition, Kind</p>

<p>Family Children Home will rent the
farm equipment to local community</p>

<p>members as Semyonovka Village cur-
rently does not have any farming</p>

<p>equipment at its disposal. This will
provide income generation for Kind
Family Children Home to maintain the
farming equipment and purchase other
necessary items for the children, while
providing a much needed service in the
community.
FOKGZ supported this program
through the Peach Corps Partnership</p>

<p>Program. The Peace Corps Partnership</p>

<p>Program (PCPP) connects small, com-
munity-initiated projects with partners in</p>

<p>the United States for financial support.
These connections not only achieve
goals in the host community, improving
the quality of life for its members, but
they foster international understanding
between the communities and partners.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1964, the Partner-
ship Program has assisted thousands of</p>

<p>Peace Corps Volunteers, in every Peace
Corps country, in order to benefit the</p>

<p>health and well-being of their host com-
munities.</p>

The Friends of Kyrgyzstan board would</p>

<p>like to thank all the members who do-
nated to FOKGZ to make this grant and</p>

<p>our continued work possible! Thank
You!</p>
